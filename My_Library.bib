@article{wiegand_using_2003,
	Abstract = {We suggest that the conscious use of information that is "hidden" in distinct structures in nature itself and in data extracted from nature ( = pattern) during the process of modeling ( = pattern-oriented modeling) can substantially improve models in ecological application and conservation. Observed patterns, such as time-series patterns and spatial patterns of presence/absence in habitat patches, contain a great deal of data on scales, site-history, parameters and processes. Use of these data provides criteria for aggregating the biological information in the model, relates the model explicitly to the relevant scales of the system, facilitates the use of helpful techniques of indirect parameter estimation with independent data, and helps detect underlying ecological processes. Additionally, pattern-oriented models produce comparative predictions that can be tested in the field. We developed a step-by-step protocol for pattern-oriented modeling and illustrate the potential of this protocol by discussing three pattern-oriented population models: (1) a population viability analysis for brown bears (Ursus arctos) in northern Spain using time-series data on females with cubs of the year to adjust unknown model parameters; (2) a savanna model for detecting underlying ecological processes from spatial patterns of tree distribution; and (3) the incidence function model of metapopulation dynamics as an example of process integration and model generalization. We conclude that using the pattern-oriented approach to its full potential will require a major paradigm shift in the strategies of modeling and data collection, and we argue that more emphasis must be placed on observing and documenting relevant patterns in addition to attempts to obtain direct estimates of model parameters.},

@article{accatino_tree-grass_2010,
	Abstract = {The mechanisms permitting the co-existence of tree and grass in savannas have been a source of contention for many years. The two main classes of explanations involve either competition for resources, or differential sensitivity to disturbances. Published models focus principally on one or the other of these mechanisms. Here we introduce a simple ecohydrologic model of savanna vegetation involving both competition for water, and differential sensitivity of trees and grasses to fire disturbances. We show how the co-existence of trees and grasses in savannas can be simultaneously controlled by rainfall and fire, and how the relative importance of the two factors distinguishes between dry and moist savannas. The stability map allows to predict the changes in vegetation structure along gradients of rainfall and fire disturbances realistically, and to clarify the distinction between climate-and disturbance-dependent ecosystems.

@article{laycock_stable_1991,
	Abstract = {The concepts of relatively stable multiple states and thresholds or transitions between these states has received little attention in range management until recently. On North American rangelands lower successional stable states occur in sagebrush and other shrub-dominated vegetation types in the Great Basin, the short-grass steppe, the Southwestern desert grasslands, and communities dominated by annual grasses in California and southern Idaho. Recognition of these stable states and models describing them are needed to develop new concepts about range condition. The model presently used assumes a single stable state (climax) and that the stages of secondary succession on improving rangelands are the reverse of the stages of retrogession. Alternative models presented include the "cup in ball" analogy, the state-and-transition model, and others. While much theoretical work needs to be done before any of these models can be incorporated into range condition standards, it is important for range managers to recognize that multiple steady states exist for many vegetation types. One assumption of the current range condition model is that a reduction in grazing pressure and an improvement in grazing management will result in range improvement. If a vegetation type is in a stable lower successional state, it normally will not respond to change in grazing or even removal of grazing. Managers must recognize this situation when it occurs so that false expectations of improvement are not fostered.},

@article{brovkin_stability_1998,
	Abstract = {A conceptual model has been developed for the analysis of atmosphere-vegetation interaction in subtropical deserts. The model can exhibit multiple stable states-in the system: a "desert" equilibrium with low precipitation and absent vegetation and a "green" equilibrium with moderate precipitation and permanent vegetation cover. The conceptual model is applied to interpret the results of two climate-vegetation models: a comprehensive coupled atmosphere-biome model and a simple hox model. In both applications, two stable states exist for the western Sahara/Sahel region for the present-day climate, and the only green equilibrium is found for the mid-Holocene climate. The latter agrees well with paleoreconstructions of Sahara/Sahel climate and vegetation. It is shown that for present-day climate the green equilibrium is less probable than the desert equilibrium, and this explains the existence of the Sahara desert as it is today. The difference in albedo between the desert and vegetation cover appears to be the main parameter that controls an existence of multiple stable states. The Charney's mechanism of self-stabilization of subtropical deserts is generalized by accounting for atmospheric hydrology, the heat and moisture exchange at the side boundaries, and taking into account the dynamic properties of the surface. The generalized mechanism explains the self-stabilization of both desert and vegetation in the western Sahara/Sahel region, The role of surface roughness in climate-vegetation interaction is shown to be of secondary importance in comparison with albedo. Furthermore, for the high albedo, precipitation increases with increasing roughness while, for the low albedo, the opposite is found.},

@article{johnson_flora_1999,
	Abstract = {The Addo Elephant National Park in the warm-temperate Eastern Cape was proclaimed in 1931 to protect one of the four elephant populations in South Africa which survived into the present century. However, since the late 1970s, a major objective of the Park is to protect intact a viable example of succulent thicket - the regional ecosystem. Succulent thicket is endemic to the Eastern Cape and forms the major component of the Albany Centre, a floristic region of high diversity and endemism, especially among succulent shrubs and geophytes. This ecosystem is poorly represented in the reserve system and is highly threatened by overgrazing and clearing for agriculture. Under the present stocking rate of more than two elephants/km(2), succulent thicket in the Park has been severely impacted: in particular, biomass, stature and plant diversity have been reduced. We show that the flora of the Park is of great regional significance. Of a total of 581 species, 12.4\% were classified as regional endemics and/or Red Data Book species (collectively termed 'species' of special concern), and 32.2\% were not known to be conserved in any other succulent thicket protected area. Relative to the remainder of the flora, both categories of species were over-represented among succulent shrubs (predominantly Euphorbiaceae and Mesembryanthemaceae) and geophytes (predominantly Asphodelaceae and Hyacinthaceae). This taxonomic and biological profile coincides with that of species vulnerable to local extinction as a result of elephant impacts. The Park authorities will need to find a solution to the conflict between maintaining a large population of megaherbivores, and maintaining the structure and diversity of succulent thicket.},

	Abstract = {It has been suggested that tropical forest and savanna could represent alternative stable states, implying critical transitions at tipping points in response to altered climate or other drivers. So far, evidence for this idea has remained elusive, and integrated climate models assume smooth vegetation responses. We analyzed data on the distribution of tree cover in Africa, Australia, and South America to reveal strong evidence for the existence of three distinct attractors: forest, savanna, and a treeless state. Empirical reconstruction of the basins of attraction indicates that the resilience of the states varies in a universal way with precipitation. These results allow the identification of regions where forest or savanna may most easily tip into an alternative state, and they pave the way to a new generation of coupled climate models.},

@article{hoffmann_hydraulic_2011,
	Abstract = {Catastrophic hydraulic failure will likely be an important mechanism contributing to large-scale tree dieback caused by increased frequency and intensity of droughts under global climate change. To compare the susceptibility of 22 temperate deciduous tree and shrub species to hydraulic failure during a record drought in the southeastern USA, we quantified leaf desiccation, native embolism, wood density, stomatal conductance and predawn and midday leaf water potential at four sites with varying drought intensities. At the two driest sites, there was widespread leaf wilting and desiccation, and most species exhibited predawn leaf water potentials of ≤3 MPa and {\textgreater}60\% loss of xylem conductivity in branches. Although species with high wood density were more resistant to cavitation, they had higher levels of native embolism and greater canopy dieback than species with low wood density. This unexpected result can be explained by the failure of species with dense wood to avert a decline in water potential to dangerous levels during the drought. Leaf water potential was negatively correlated with wood density, and the relationship was strongest under conditions of severe water deficit. Species with low wood density avoided catastrophic embolism by relying on an avoidance strategy that involves partial drought deciduousness, higher sensitivity of stomata to leaf water potential and perhaps greater rooting depth. These species therefore maintained water potential at levels that ensured a greater margin of safety against embolism. These differences among species may mediate rapid shifts in species composition of temperate forests if droughts intensify due to climate change.},

	Abstract = {Changes in vegetation cover in northern Chobe National Park (Botswana) were assessed using aerial photographs from 1962, 1985 and 1998, with subsequent ground proofing. In addition, cumulative browsing by elephants and the occurrence of fire scars were recorded on random vegetation sites within shrubland (n = 20) and mixed woodland (n = 20). Coverage of woodland vegetation decreased from 60\% to 30\% between 1962 and 1998, while shrubland vegetation increased from 5\% to 33\% during the same period. During the study period, woodland has gradually retreated away from the river front. While riparian forest covered a continuous area along the riverfront in 1962, only fragments were left in 1998. We found a significant decrease in browse use with increasing distance to the Chobe river for Combretum apiculatum, Combretum elaeagnoides, Combretum mossambicense and other woody plants combined (all P {\textless} 0.0001). The occurrence of fire (P {\textless} 0.0001) and basal area (P {\textless} 0.0001) were positively related to distance to the river. Elephant browsing occurred on {\textgreater}70\% of available stems within 2 km from the river, while less than 20\% of the trees had fire scars in the same zone. Beyond 7 km from the river, elephant browsing was reduced to {\textgreater}50\% of available stems, while more than 50\% of the trees had fire scars. The density of any of the shrubs was not related to distance to the river neither within shrubland (all P {\textgreater} 0.05) nor within mixed woodlands (all P {\textgreater} 0.05).},

@article{raynaud_symmetry_2005,
	Abstract = {We studied the symmetry of belowground competition at the level of species using a model of plant competition at the scale of individual roots. This model predicts the nutrient uptake of plants with varying root densities and uptake kinetics, competing for the same resource, at equilibrium between resource supply and plant uptake. A symmetry parameter is derived from this model. The analysis of the model behaviour suggests that the symmetry of belowground competition depends on the diffusive supply of the nutrient (buffer capacity x effective diffusion coefficient) for which competition occurs. As the diffusive supply is determined to a greater extent by soil water content and soil type rather than by nutrient type, this means that the symmetry of belowground competition should vary with soil water content and soil type. In particular, our model suggests that competition for nutrients that are primarily supplied by diffusion through the soil is (1) symmetrical at high diffusive supply when root uptake kinetics are identical or at low diffusive supply when roots are randomly distributed in the soil whatever their uptake kinetics are, (2) size-asymmetrical at high diffusive supply when root uptake kinetics are different, (3) partially symmetric or size-asymmetric at low diffusive supply when root are not randomly distributed in the soil.

	Abstract = {Amazon forests are a key but poorly understood component of the global carbon cycle. If, as anticipated, they dry this century, they might accelerate climate change through carbon losses and changed surface energy balances. We used records from multiple long-term monitoring plots across Amazonia to assess forest responses to the intense 2005 drought, a possible analog of future events. Affected forest lost biomass, reversing a large long-term carbon sink, with the greatest impacts observed where the dry season was unusually intense. Relative to pre-2005 conditions, forest subjected to a 100-millimeter increase in water deficit lost 5.3 megagrams of aboveground biomass of carbon per hectare. The drought had a total biomass carbon impact of 1.2 to 1.6 petagrams (1.2 × 1015 to 1.6 × 1015 grams). Amazon forests therefore appear vulnerable to increasing moisture stress, with the potential for large carbon losses to exert feedback on climate change.},

	Abstract = {Over the last decade, investigations on root water uptake have evolved toward a deeper integration of the soil and roots compartment properties, with the goal of improving our understanding of water acquisition from drying soils. This evolution parallels the increasing attention of agronomists to suboptimal crop production environments. Recent results have led to the description of root system architectures that might contribute to deep-water extraction or to water-saving strategies. In addition, the manipulation of root hydraulic properties would provide further opportunities to improve water uptake. However, modeling studies highlight the role of soil hydraulics in the control of water uptake in drying soil and call for integrative soil-plant system approaches.},

	Abstract = {We examined 15 traits in leaves and stems related to leaf C economy and water use for 32 co-existing angiosperms at ridge sites with shallow soil in the Bonin Islands. Across species, stem density was positively correlated to leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf lifespan (LLS), and total phenolics and condensed tannins per unit leaf N (N-based), and negatively correlated to leaf osmotic potential and saturated water content in leaves. LMA and LLS were negatively correlated to photosynthetic parameters, such as area-, mass-, and N-based assimilation rates. Although stem density and leaf osmotic potential were not associated with photosynthetic parameters, they were associated with some parameters of the leaf C economy, such as LMA and LLS. In the principal component (PCA) analysis, the first three axes accounted for 74.4\% of total variation. Axis 1, which explained 41.8\% of the total variation, was well associated with parameters for leaf C and N economy. Similarly, axis 2, which explained 22.3\% of the total variation, was associated with parameters for water use. Axis 3, which explained 10.3\% of the total variation, was associated with chemical defense within leaves. Axes 1 and 2 separated functional types relatively well, i.e., creeping trees, ruderal trees, other woody plants, C-3 shrubs and forbs, palms, and CAM plants, indicating that plant functional types were characterized by similar attributes of traits related to leaf C and N economy and water use. In addition, when the plot was extended by two unrelated traits, leaf mass-based assimilation rates and stem density, it also separated these functional types. These data indicate that differences in the functional types with contrasting plant strategies can be attributed to functional integration among leaf C economy, hydraulics, and leaf longevity, and that both leaf mass-based assimilation rates and stem density are key factors reflecting the different functions of plant species.},

@article{meyer_satchmo:_2007,
	Abstract = {Many mechanisms have been suggested to explain the coexistence of woody species and grasses in savannas, yet, evidence from field studies and simulation models has been mixed. Shrub encroachment is an ecological and economic problem in savannas worldwide which generally is attributed to overgrazing. Patch-dynamics is a new mechanism explaining tree-grass coexistence and the natural occurrence of shrub encroachment in savannas. A patch-dynamic savanna consists of patches in which cyclical succession between grassy and woody dominance proceeds spatially asynchronously. The spatially explicit, individual-based patch-scale simulation model SATCHMO was developed to investigate cyclical succession in the paradigm of patch-dynamics for arid and semi-arid savannas. SATCHMO is designed to capture within-patch shrub population dynamics based on a grid of 51 m side length and a resolution of 10 cm. The model shrub characteristics were derived from Acacia mellifera, the main encroaching species in African savannas. The aim of SATCHMO is to give a detailed small-scale understanding of above- and belowground growth, competition, and mortality of savanna woody plants and the influence of precipitation and fire on patch transition frequencies, shrub growth rates, and shrub size frequencies. With SATCHMO, we want to identify the conditions leading to cyclical successions in general and shrub encroachment in particular. Soil moisture is the most important parameter in SATCHMO influencing growth, reproduction, and mortality of shrubs and grass tufts, and that mediates competition. To acknowledge the importance of belowground interactions in savannas, shrub root growth and competition are modelled spatially explicitly. The model output was successfully validated with morphometrical and spatial data from the field site in the South African Kalahari thornveld and with recent literature data on savanna woody species cover. Global sensitivity analysis with Latin hypercube sampling shows that soil moisture is the most important driver of shrub cover dynamics in semi-arid savannas.},

	Abstract = {1. Relationships between above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) of grasslands and annual precipitation are often weak at the site level, with much of the inter-annual variation in ANPP left unexplained. A potential reason for this is that the distribution of precipitation within a growing season affects productivity in addition to the total amount. 2. We analysed long-term ANPP data for three southern African temperate grasslands (mean annual precipitation ranging from 538 mm to 798 mm) to determine the effects of precipitation event size, number and spacing relative to seasonal totals. 3. Ungrazed, non-manipulated treatments at each site showed contrasting results despite sharing a common, dominant species. At the driest site, a model combining average event size and number of events per growing season provided a substantially better fit to the ANPP data than precipitation amount (seasonal total). At the wettest site, the interval between events was the most important precipitation variable. Precipitation distribution was not important at the intermediate site where amount was the best predictor of ANPP. A limit to the size of precipitation events efficiently utilized for ANPP was evident for the driest site only. 4. At each site, experimental treatments that altered species composition and soil fertility had little effect on precipitation-ANPP relationships. The lack of consistency in the relative importance of the precipitation variables among sites suggests that local, edaphic factors modify precipitation-ANPP relationships. 5. This analysis demonstrates that the distribution and size of precipitation events can affect ANPP independent of precipitation amount. As altered precipitation regimes are forecast by global climate models, the sensitivity of ecosystems to precipitation distribution should be considered when predicting responses to climate change. 6. While mean values of precipitation, and other ecosystem drivers, are typically used to predict function at the level of whole ecosystems, our results show that more complex measures of environmental variability may be required to understand ecosystem function, and to increase the accuracy of predictions of ecosystem responses to global change.},

	Abstract = {A simulation model of light partitioning in horizontally homogeneous multispecies canopies is proposed. The model is based on the Kubelka-Munk equations (KM) applied to a mixture of N vegetation components. Only two hemispherical fluxes, i.e. downwards and upwards, are considered. The exact solution of KM equations was then simplified in such a way that the model can be easily extended to multispecies canopies including several vegetation layers. The simplified KM model (KMS) was compared to two other light models dealing with mixed canopies: the more detailed model SIRASCA [Sinoquet, H., Moulia, B., Gastal, F., Bonhomme, R., Varlet-Grancher, C., 1990. Modeling the radiative balance of the components of a well-mixed canopy: application to a white clover-tall fescue mixture. Acta Oecol. 11, 469-486], and the simpler model ERIN [Wallace, J.S., 1997. Evaporation and radiation interception by neighbouring plants. Q. J. R. Meteorol. Sec. 123, 1885-1905]. All three models were applied to theoretical two-species monolayer canopies, and to actual mixed canopies, the geometry of which was retrieved from the literature. In the PAR waveband, the model KMS gave simulation results very similar to those of SIRASCA in case of contrasted canopy structures. In conditions of high leaf and soil scattering, deviations between SIRASCA and KMS outputs were higher and reached maximum values of -0.08 for erectophile species. Comparison between SIRASCA and ERIN outputs showed that ERIN largely underestimated light competition in a two-component canopy in several conditions, due to light partitioning only based on height differences between components. Simulations also showed the significant effect of the vertical distribution of leaf area on light partitioning in the case of mixtures where components had equal or different heights. Finally it appears that the model KMS could be a candidate for inclusion in growth models for multispecies canopies, since all KMS parameters have physical meaning and it is very easy to implement.

	Abstract = {In big-leaf models of canopy photosynthesis, the Rubisco activity per unit ground area is taken as the sum of activities per unit leaf area within the canopy, and electron transport capacity is similarly summed. Such models overestimate rates of photosynthesis and require empirical curvature factors in the response to irradiance, We show that, with any distribution of leaf nitrogen within the canopy (including optimal), the required curvature factors are not constant but vary with canopy Leaf area index and leaf nitrogen content. We further show that the underlying reason is the difference between the time-averaged and instantaneous distributions of absorbed irradiance, caused by penetration of sunflecks and the range of leaf angles in canopies. These errors are avoided in models that treat the canopy in terms of a number of layers - the multi-layer models. We present an alternative to the multi-layer model: by separately integrating the sunlit and shaded leaf fractions of the canopy, a single layered sun/shade model is obtained, which is as accurate and simpler. The model is a scaled version of a leaf model as distinct from an integrative approach.},

@article{cornwell_community_2009,
	Abstract = {Community assembly processes are thought to shape the mean, spread, and spacing of functional trait values within communities. Two broad categories of assembly processes have been proposed: first, a habitat filter that restricts the range of viable strategies and second, a partitioning of microsites and/or resources that leads to a limit to the similarity of coexisting species. The strength of both processes may be dependent on conditions at a particular site and may change along an abiotic gradient. We sampled environmental variables and plant communities in 44 plots across the varied topography of a coastal California landscape. We characterized 14 leaf, stem, and root traits for 54 woody plant species, including detailed intraspecific data for two traits with the goal of understanding the connection between traits and assembly processes in a variety of environmental conditions. We examined the within-community mean, range, variance, kurtosis, and other measures of spacing of trait values. In this landscape, there was a topographically mediated gradient in water availability. Across this gradient we observed strong shifts in both the plot-level mean trait values and the variation in trait values within communities. Trends in trait means with the environment were due largely to species turnover, with intraspecific shifts playing a smaller role. Traits associated with a vertical partitioning of light showed a greater range and variance on the wet soils, while nitrogen per area, which is associated with water use efficiency, showed a greater spread on the dry soils. We found strong nonrandom patterns in the trait distributions consistent with expectations based on trait-mediated community assembly. There was a significant reduction in the range of six out of 11 leaf and stem functional trait values relative to a null model. For specific leaf area (SLA) we found a significant even spacing of trait values relative to the null model. For seed size we found a more platykurtic distribution than expected. These results suggest that both a habitat filter and a limit to the similarity of coexisting species can simultaneously shape the distribution of traits and the assembly of local plant communities.},

	Abstract = {* 1 In water-limited environments, the availability of water and nutrients to plants depends on environmental conditions, sizes and shapes of their root systems, and root competition. The goal of this study was to predict root system sizes and shapes for different plant growth forms using data on above-ground plant sizes, climate and soil texture.
* 2 A new data set of {\textgreater} 1300 records of root system sizes for individual plants was collected from the literature for deserts, scrublands, grasslands and savannas with ≤ 1000 mm mean annual precipitation (MAP). Maximum rooting depths, maximum lateral root spreads and their ratios were measured.
* 3 Root system sizes differed among growth forms and increased with above-ground size: annuals {\textless} perennial forbs = grasses {\textless} semi-shrubs {\textless} shrubs {\textless} trees. Stem succulents were as shallowly rooted as annuals but had lateral root spreads similar to shrubs.
* 4 Absolute rooting depths increased with MAP in all growth forms except shrubs and trees, but were not strongly related to potential evapotranspiration (PET). Except in trees, root systems tended to be shallower and wider in dry and hot climates and deeper and narrower in cold and wet climates. Shrubs were more shallowly rooted under climates with summer than winter precipitation regimes.
* 5 Relative to above-ground plant sizes, root system sizes decreased with increasing PET for all growth forms, but decreased with increasing MAP only for herbaceous plants. Thus relative rooting depths tended to increase with aridity, although absolute rooting depths decreased with aridity.
* 6 Using an independent data set of 20 test locations, rooting depths were predicted from MAP using regression models for three broad growth forms. The models succeeded in explaining 62\% of the observed variance in median rooting depths.
* 7 Based on the data analysed here, Walter's two-layer model of soil depth partitioning between woody and herbaceous plants appears to be most appropriate in drier regimes ({\textless} 500 mm MAP) and in systems with substantial winter precipitation.},

We linked the ecosystem model with an advanced hydrological model (JULES) and used its soil moisture and soil temperature as input into the ecosystem model. We analysed these sensitivities along a latitudinal gradient in northern Russia. Differences in soil temperature and soil moisture had only little influence on the vegetation carbon fluxes, whereas the soil carbon fluxes were very sensitive to the JULES soil estimations. The sensitivity changed with latitude, showing stronger influence in the more northern grid cell. The sensitivity of modelled responses of both soil carbon fluxes and vegetation carbon fluxes to uncertainties in soil temperature were high, as both soil and vegetation carbon fluxes were strongly impacted. In contrast, uncertainties in the estimation of the amount of precipitation had little influence on the soil or vegetation carbon fluxes. The high sensitivity of soil respiration to soil temperature and moisture suggests that we should strive for a better understanding and representation of soil processes in ecosystem models to improve the reliability of predictions of future ecosystem changes.},

	Abstract = {A modelling approach based on generally valid geometrical formulas and simple statistical procedures is presented with the aim of predicting the total rooting density and rooting distributions along the soil profile for different vegetation communities. The model needs as basic data: (1) data from the literature on rooting of individual species (root form, rooting density, main root depth, lateral extension) and (2) standard phytosociological values (e.g. subplot frequency or modified Braun-Blanquet frequency/abundance values) for the combination of the rooting values for each species to the community rooting value. Our data clearly show that the modelled results of the total rooting of vegetation communities correlate well with the measured values. The correlation coefficients obtained from the comparison are high (0.89-0.92) and always highly significant. However, when the model is used to calculate only the rooting of a partial soil layer, then the accuracy of the result increases with increasing soil layer thickness. The agreement between measured and calculated data indicate that the model is very sensitive to species-specific differences within a vegetation community. Due to the integrated data and the mathematical concept, the model is not subject to any bio-geographical restrictions. When the necessary data are available, this modelling approach could be used for the calculation of the rooting of all terrestrial biomes. Consequently, it could be also be used as a module for hydrological, biochemical and ecological models. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Ecologists still search for common principles that predict well-known responses of biological diversity to different factors(1-4) Such factors include the number of available niches in space(5-7), productivity(8-10), area(10), species' body size(11-14) and habitat fragmentation. Here we show that all these patterns can arise from simple constraints on how organisms acquire resources in space. We use spatial scaling laws to describe how species of different sizes find food in patches of varying size and resource concentration. We then derive a mathematical rule for the minimum similarity in size of species that share these resources. This packing rule yields a theory of species diversity that predicts relations between diversity and productivity more effectively than previous models(8-10). Size and diversity patterns for locally coexisting East African grazing mammals and North American savanna plants strongly support these predictions. The theory also predicts relations between diversity and area and between diversity and habitat fragmentation. Thus, spatial scaling laws provide potentially unifying first principles that may explain many important patterns of species diversity.},

	Abstract = {* Premise of the study: The density of wood is highly correlated with the ability of stems and roots to resist bending or twisting, which is important for evaluating the mechanical behavior of trees. It also provides a measure of carbon storage, which is an important variable in modeling ecosystem processes and tree construction costs. However, most measurements of the density and mechanical properties of wood have little direct bearing on understanding the biomechanics of living plants because they are based on kiln- or air-dried samples.
* Methods: Here, we present and analyze the relationships between four important mechanical properties (Young's modulus, the modulus of rupture, and the maximum strength in shearing and in compression) and the density of green wood (i.e., wood at 50\% moisture content) from a worldwide, taxonomically broad spectrum of 161 species.
* Key results: These data indicate that each of the mechanical properties disproportionately increases across species with increasing green wood density, i.e., stems composed of denser green wood are disproportionately stiffer and stronger than stems with equivalent cross-sections composed of less dense green wood.
* Conclusions: Although denser wood may have a higher carbon construction cost, the mechanical benefits of denser woods likely outweigh the extra cost.},

	Abstract = {Aim  To develop a physiologically based model of the plant niche for use in species distribution modelling. Location  Europe. Methods  We link the Thornley transport resistance (TTR) model with functions which describe how the TTR's model parameters are influenced by abiotic environmental factors. The TTR model considers how carbon and nutrient uptake, and the allocation of these assimilates, influence growth. We use indirect statistical methods to estimate the model parameters from a high resolution data set on tree distribution for 22 European tree species. Results  We infer, from distribution data and abiotic forcing data, the physiological niche dimensions of 22 European tree species. We found that the model fits were reasonable (AUC: 0.79--0.964). The projected distributions were characterized by a false positive rate of 0.19 and a false negative rate 0.12. The fitted models are used to generate projections of the environmental factors that limit the range boundaries of the study species. Main conclusions  We show that physiological models can be used to derive physiological niche dimensions from species distribution data.

Summary
Severe droughts have been associated with regional-scale forest mortality worldwide. Climate change is expected to exacerbate regional mortality events; however, prediction remains difficult because the physiological mechanisms underlying drought survival and mortality are poorly understood. We developed a hydraulically based theory considering carbon balance and insect resistance that allowed development and examination of hypotheses regarding survival and mortality. Multiple mechanisms may cause mortality during drought. A common mechanism for plants with isohydric regulation of water status results from avoidance of drought-induced hydraulic failure via stomatal closure, resulting in carbon starvation and a cascade of downstream effects such as reduced resistance to biotic agents. Mortality by hydraulic failure per se may occur for isohydric seedlings or trees near their maximum height. Although anisohydric plants are relatively drought-tolerant, they are predisposed to hydraulic failure because they operate with narrower hydraulic safety margins during drought. Elevated temperatures should exacerbate carbon starvation and hydraulic failure. Biotic agents may amplify and be amplified by drought-induced plant stress. Wet multidecadal climate oscillations may increase plant susceptibility to drought-induced mortality by stimulating shifts in hydraulic architecture, effectively predisposing plants to water stress. Climate warming and increased frequency of extreme events will probably cause increased regional mortality episodes. Isohydric and anisohydric water potential regulation may partition species between survival and mortality, and, as such, incorporating this hydraulic framework may be effective for modeling plant survival and mortality under future climate conditions.},

	Abstract = {Effective measures to counter the rising levels of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere require that we better understand the functioning of the global carbon cycle. Uncertainties about, in particular, the terrestrial carbon cycle's response to climate change remain high. We use a well-known stochastic inversion technique originally developed in nuclear physics, the Metropolis algorithm, to determine the full probability density functions (PDFs) of parameters of a terrestrial ecosystem model. By thus assimilating half-hourly eddy covariance measurements of CO2 and water fluxes, we can substantially reduce the uncertainty of approximately five model parameters, depending on prior uncertainties. Further analysis of the posterior PDF shows that almost all parameters are nearly Gaussian distributed, and reveals some distinct groups of parameters that are constrained together. We show that after assimilating only 7 days of measurements, uncertainties for net carbon uptake over 2 years for the forest site can be substantially reduced, with the median estimate in excellent agreement with measurements.},

The models use fundamentally different mathematical approaches and the predictions can differ considerably.

Traitspace predicts low probabilities for any species whose trait distribution does not pass through the environmental filter. Neither model maximizes functional diversity because of the emphasis on environmental filtering over limiting similarity. Traitspace can test for the effects of limiting similarity by explicitly incorporating intraspecific trait variation.

The water balance is described through the representation of rainfall as a marked Poisson process, which in turn produces an infiltration into the soil dependent on the existing level of soil moisture. The losses from the soil are due to evapotranspiration and leakage, which are also considered dependent on the existing soil moisture. The steady-state probability distributions for soil moisture are then analytically obtained. The analysis of the distribution allows for the assessment of the role of climate, soil and vegetation on soil moisture dynamics. Further hydrologic insight is obtained by studying the various components of an average water balance. The realistic representation of the processes acting at a site and the analytical tractability of the model make it well suited for further analyses that consider the spatial aspect of soil moisture dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Results of an intercomparison among terrestrial biogeochemical models (TBMs) are reported, in which one diagnostic and five prognostic models have been run with the same long-term climate forcing. Monthly fields of net ecosystem production (NEP), which is the difference between net primary production (NPP) and heterotrophic respiration R-H, at 0.5 degrees resolution have been generated for the terrestrial biosphere, The monthly estimates of NEP in conjunction with seasonal CO2 flux fields generated by the seasonal Hamburg Model of the Oceanic Carbon Cycle (HAMOCC3) and fossil fuel source fields were subsequently coupled to the three-dimensional atmospheric tracer transport model TM2 forced by observed winds. The resulting simulated seasonal signal of the atmospheric CO2 concentration extracted at the grid cells corresponding to the locations of 27 background monitoring stations of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory network is compared with measurements from these sites. The Simple Diagnostic Biosphere Model(SDBM1), which is tuned to the atmospheric CO2 concentration at five monitoring stations in the northern hemisphere, successfully reproduced the seasonal signal of CO2 at the other monitoring stations. The SDBM1 simulations confirm that the north-south gradient in the amplitude of the atmospheric CO2 signal results from the greater northern hemisphere land area and the more pronounced seasonality of radiation and temperature in higher latitudes. In southern latitudes, ocean-atmosphere gas exchange plays an important role in determining the seasonal signal of CO2. Most of the five prognostic models (i.e., models driven by climatic inputs) included in the intercomparison predict in the northern hemisphere a reasonably accurate seasonal cycle in terms of amplitude and, to some extent, also with respect to phase. In the tropics, however, the prognostic models generally tend to overpredict the net seasonal exchanges and stronger seasonal cycles than indicated by the diagnostic model and by observations. The differences from the observed seasonal signal of CO2 may be caused by shortcomings in the phenology algorithms of the prognostic models or by not properly considering the effects of land use and vegetation fires on CO2 fluxes between the atmosphere and terrestrial biosphere.},

	Abstract = {Seven climate models were used to explore the biogeophysical impacts of human-induced land cover change (LCC) at regional and global scales. The imposed LCC led to statistically significant decreases in the northern hemisphere summer latent heat flux in three models, and increases in three models. Five models simulated statistically significant cooling in summer in near-surface temperature over regions of LCC and one simulated warming. There were few significant changes in precipitation. Our results show no common remote impacts of LCC. The lack of consistency among the seven models was due to: 1) the implementation of LCC despite agreed maps of agricultural land, 2) the representation of crop phenology, 3) the parameterisation of albedo, and 4) the representation of evapotranspiration for different land cover types. This study highlights a dilemma: LCC is regionally significant, but it is not feasible to impose a common LCC across multiple models for the next IPCC assessment. Citation: Pitman, A. J., et al.

	Abstract = {* Plant function requires effective mechanisms to regulate water transport at a variety of scales. Here, we develop a new theoretical framework describing plant responses to drying soil, based on the relationship between midday and predawn leaf water potentials. The intercept of the relationship (Λ) characterizes the maximum transpiration rate per unit of hydraulic transport capacity, whereas the slope (σ) measures the relative sensitivity of the transpiration rate and plant hydraulic conductance to declining water availability.


* This framework was applied to a newly compiled global database of leaf water potentials to estimate the values of Λ and σ for 102 plant species.


* Our results show that our characterization of drought responses is largely consistent within species, and that the parameters Λ and σ show meaningful associations with climate across species. Parameter σ was ≤1 in most species, indicating a tight coordination between the gas and liquid phases of water transport, in which canopy transpiration tended to decline faster than hydraulic conductance during drought, thus reducing the pressure drop through the plant.


* The quantitative framework presented here offers a new way of characterizing water transport regulation in plants that can be used to assess their vulnerability to drought under current and future climatic conditions.},

The height to which trees can grow and the biophysical determinants of maximum height are poorly understood. Some models predict heights of up to 120 m in the absence of mechanical damage(3,4), but there are historical accounts of taller trees(5). Current hypotheses of height limitation focus on increasing water transport constraints in taller trees and the resulting reductions in leaf photosynthesis(6). We studied redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens), including the tallest known tree on Earth (112.7 m), in wet temperate forests of northern California. Our regression analyses of height gradients in leaf functional characteristics estimate a maximum tree height of 122-130 m barring mechanical damage, similar to the tallest recorded trees of the past. As trees grow taller, increasing leaf water stress due to gravity and path length resistance may ultimately limit leaf expansion and photosynthesis for further height growth, even with ample soil moisture.},

@article{shipley_balanced-growth_2002,
	Abstract = {1. Many ecological models of plant growth assume balanced growth: that biomass is allocated preferentially to leaves or roots to increase capture of the limiting external resource. An alternative explanation is based on nonlinear (allometric) allocation as a function of plant size. The objective of this study was to test between these two alternative explanations.2. A total of 1150 plants from 22 different herbaceous species were grown in hydroponic sand culture in factorial combinations of high (1100 µmol m−2 s−1) and low (200 µmol m−2 s−1 PAR) irradiance crossed with a full-strength and a 1/6 dilution of Hoagland's hydroponic solution. Plants were harvested at 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 days postgermination, and dry mass was determined for leaf and root components. These data were used to test the hypotheses of balanced growth and of allometric allocation.3. Both irradiance and nutrient supply affected the slope and intercept of the root : shoot allometry, contrary to the allometric hypothesis but in agreement with the hypothesis of balanced growth; decreased nutrient supply increased allocation to roots; and decreased irradiance increased allocation to leaves.4. Plants allocated relatively more biomass to roots than to leaves as plants grew larger. In order for the balanced-growth hypothesis to be correct, the net rate of nutrient uptake per unit root mass must have been decreasing relative to the net rate of carbon gain per unit leaf mass.5. We suggest two reasons why this might be the case: (i) older roots decreased their efficiency of nutrient uptake; and (ii) larger root systems more rapidly decreased the available nutrients between flushes of hydroponic solution.6. These results support the notion of balanced growth that is found in many ecological models of plant growth.},

The task is accomplished by means of a minimal model encapsulating a few assumptions on the interactions between overstory and understory species and on the mechanisms of fire development and transmission. The main difference with other models for fire prediction and simulation is that, here, fire is an endogenous variable with purely deterministic dynamics. Nevertheless, the analysis shows that fire recurrence can be chaotic for parameter values corresponding to Mediterranean forests. By contrast, the model shows that boreal forests and savannas have the tendency to experience periodic fires.

	Abstract = {Functional diversity is critical for ecosystem dynamics, stability and productivity. However, dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) which are increasingly used to simulate ecosystem functions under global change, condense functional diversity to Plant Functional Types (PFTs) with constant parameters. Here, we develop an individual- and trait-based version of the dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) LPJmL (Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land) called LPJmL-FIT (LPJmL with Flexible Individual Traits) which we apply to generate plant trait maps for the Amazon basin. LPJmL-FIT incorporates empirical ranges of five traits of tropical trees extracted from the TRY global plant trait database, namely specific leaf area (SLA), leaf longevity (LL), leaf nitrogen content (Narea), the maximum carboxylation rate of RUBISCO per leaf area (Vcmaxarea), and wood density (WD). To scale the individual growth performance of trees, the leaf traits are linked by trade-offs based on the leaf economics spectrum, whereas wood density is linked to tree mortality. No pre-selection of growth strategies is taking place, because individuals with unique trait combinations are uniformly distributed at tree establishment. We validate the modeled trait distributions by empirical trait data and the modeled biomass by a remote sensing product along a climatic gradient. Including trait variability and trade-offs successfully predicts natural trait distributions and achieves a more realistic representation of functional diversity at the local to regional scale. As sites of high climatic variability, the fringes of the Amazon promote trait divergence and the coexistence of multiple tree growth strategies, whilst lower plant trait diversity is found in the species-rich center of the region with relatively low climatic variability.

	Abstract = {1. We develop an individuals-based model that predicts the strength of interference between foraging animals from basic elements of their behaviour. The model is based on the same principles as previous behaviour-based interference models, but extends and adds further realism to these models. One key difference is that in our model the responses of animals to competitors are not fixed, as is assumed in previous models. Instead, animals use optimal decision rules to determine responses which maximize their intake rate. 2. The general shape of interference function generated by the model is similar to that predicted by previous behaviour-based models. Interference is insignificant at low competitor densities, but steadily increases in intensity as density rises. However, comparison with the observed level of interference between oystercatchers, Haematopus ostralegus, feeding on mussels, Mytilus edulis, shows that the model's predictive power is substantially increased through the addition of optimal decision rules. When animals have a fixed response to encounters, too much interference occurs because dominant animals waste time avoiding subdominants and subdominants waste time attempting, but failing, to steal prey from dominants. When animals use optimal decision rules, only subdominants avoid, and only dominants initiate attacks. Interference is therefore reduced and is much closer to that observed. 3. The conditions under which optimal decision rules will lead to interference are described in terms of basic elements of foraging behaviour. Interference is predicted to occur when handling time and the probability of winning fights are high, and when prey encounter rate and the duration of fights are low. These parameters are used to predict successfully the presence or absence of interference in a range of shorebird-prey systems. 4. We suggest that behaviour-based interference models will need to incorporate optimal decision rules if they are to predict accurately the strength of interference observed in real predator-prey systems.},

The model divides a litter into four different substrate quality classes with different decomposition rates which are differently influenced by temperature, soil moisture content, pH and aluminum concentration in the soil solution. The model is presented with its core equations and parameter values, but also presented from a system dynamics perspective in its context as a cornerstone in a forest-soil-atmosphere model. DECOMP is aimed at simulating long-term dynamics of decomposition over several forest management rotations, and to function in concert with other model components used in forest modeling.

	Abstract = {In this paper, the predator-prey system with the Beddington-DeAngelis functional response is developed, by introducing a proportional periodic impulsive catching or poisoning for the prey populations and a constant periodic releasing for the predator. The Beddington-DeAngelis functional response is similar to the Holling type II functional response but contains an extra term describing mutual interference by predators. This model has the potential to protect predator from extinction, but under some conditions may also lead to extinction of the prey. That is, the system exists a locally stable prey-eradication periodic solution when the impulsive period satisfies an inequality. The condition for permanence is established via the method of comparison involving multiple Liapunov functions. Further, by numerical simulation method the influences of the impulsive perturbations and mutual interference by predators on the inherent oscillation are investigated. With the increasing of releasing for the predator, the system appears a series of complex phenomenon, which include (1) period-doubling, (2) chaos attractor, (3) period-halfing. (4) non-unique dynamics (meaning that several attractors coexist). (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {* Tropical savannas cover a large proportion of the Earth's land surface and many people are dependent on the ecosystem services that savannas supply. Their sustainable management is crucial. Owing to the complexity of savanna vegetation dynamics, climate change and land use impacts on savannas are highly uncertain.


* We used a dynamic vegetation model, the adaptive dynamic global vegetation model (aDGVM), to project how climate change and fire management might influence future vegetation in northern Australian savannas.


* Under future climate conditions, vegetation can store more carbon than under ambient conditions. Changes in rainfall seasonality influence future carbon storage but do not turn vegetation into a carbon source, suggesting that CO2 fertilization is the main driver of vegetation change. The application of prescribed fires with varying return intervals and burning season influences vegetation and fire impacts. Carbon sequestration is maximized with early dry season fires and long fire return intervals, while grass productivity is maximized with late dry season fires and intermediate fire return intervals.


* The study has implications for management policy across Australian savannas because it identifies how fire management strategies may influence grazing yield, carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions. This knowledge is crucial to maintaining important ecosystem services of Australian savannas.},

@article{duursma_predicting_2008,
	Abstract = {The effect of drought on forest water use is often estimated with models, but comprehensive models require many parameters, and simple models may not be sufficiently flexible. Many tree species, Pinus species in particular, have been shown to maintain a constant minimum leaf water potential above the critical threshold for xylem embolism during drought. In such cases, prediction of the relative decline in daily maximum transpiration rate with decreasing soil water content is relatively straightforward. We constructed a soil--plant water flow model assuming constant plant conductance and daily minimum leaf water potential, but variable conductance from soil to root. We tested this model against independent data from two sites: automatic shoot chamber data and sap flow measurements from a boreal Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand; and sap flow measurements from a maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) stand. To focus on soil limitations to water uptake, we expressed daily maximum transpiration rate relative to the rate that would be obtained in wet soil with similar environmental variables. The comparison was successful, although the maritime pine stand showed carry-over effects of the drought that we could not explain. For the boreal Scots pine stand, daily maximum transpiration was best predicted by water content of soil deeper than 5 cm. A sensitivity analysis revealed that model predictions were relatively insensitive to the minimum leaf water potential, which can be accounted for by the importance of soil resistance of drying soil. We conclude that a model with constant plant conductance and minimum leaf water potential can accurately predict the decline in daily maximum transpiration rate during drought for these two pine stands, and that including further detail about plant compartments would add little predictive power, except in predicting recovery from severe drought.},

@article{ehleringer_c_1997,
	Abstract = {The objectives of this synthesis are (1) to review the factors that influence the ecological, geographical, and palaeoecological distributions of plants possessing C-4 photosynthesis and (2) to propose a hypothesis/model to explain both the distribution of C-4 plants with respect to temperature and CO2 and why C-4 photosynthesis is relatively uncommon in dicotyledonous plants (hereafter dicots), especially in comparison with its widespread distribution in monocotyledonous species (hereafter monocots). Our goal is to stimulate discussion of the factors controlling distributions of C-4 plants today, historically, and under future elevated CO2 environments. Understanding the distributions of C-3/C-4 plants impacts not only primary productivity, but also the distribution, evolution, and migration of both invertebrates and vertebrates that graze on these plants. Sixteen separate studies all indicate that the current distributions of C-4 monocots are tightly correlated with temperature: elevated temperatures during the growing season favor C-4 monocots. In contrast, the seven studies on C-4 dicot distributions suggest that a different environmental parameter, such as aridity (combination of temperature and evaporative potential), more closely describes their distributions. Differences in the temperature dependence of the quantum yield for CO2 uptake (light-use efficiency) of C-3 and C-4 species relate well to observed plant distributions and light-use efficiency is the only mechanism that has been proposed to explain distributional differences in C-3/C-4 monocots. Modeling of C-3 and C-4 light-use efficiencies under different combinations of atmospheric CO2 and temperature predicts that C-4-dominated ecosystems should not have expanded until atmospheric CO2 concentrations reached the lower levels that are thought to have existed beginning near the end of the Miocene. At that time, palaeocarbonate and fossil data indicate a simultaneous, global expansion of C-4-dominated grasslands. The C-4 monocots generally have a higher quantum yield than C-4 dicots and it is proposed that leaf venation patterns play a role in increasing the light-use efficiency of most C-4 monocots. The reduced quantum yield of most C-4 dicots is consistent with their rarity, and it is suggested that C-4 dicots may not have been selected until CO2 concentrations reached their lowest levels during glacial maxima in the Quaternary. Given the intrinsic light-use efficiency advantage of C-4 monocots, C-4 dicots may have been limited in their distributions to the warmest ecosystems, saline ecosystems, and/or to highly disturbed ecosystems. All C-4 plants have a significant advantage over C-3 plants under low atmospheric CO2 conditions and are predicted to have expanded significantly on a global scale during full-glacial periods, especially in tropical regions. Bog and lake sediment cores as well as pedogenic carbonates support the hypothesis that C-4 ecosystems were more extensive during the last glacial maximum and then decreased in abundance following deglaciation as atmospheric CO2 levels increased.},

@article{rykiel_testing_1996,
	Abstract = {The ecological literature reveals considerable confusion about the meaning of validation in the context of simulation models. The confusion arises as much from semantic and philosophical considerations as from the selection of validation procedures. Validation is not a procedure for testing scientific theory or for certifying the 'truth' of current scientific understanding, nor is it a required activity of every modelling project. Validation means that a model is acceptable for its intended use because it meets specified performance requirements. Before validation is undertaken, (1) the purpose of the model, (2) the performance criteria, and (3) the model context must be specified. The validation process can be decomposed into several components: (1) operation, (2) theory, and (3) data. Important concepts needed to understand the model evaluation process are verification, calibration, validation, credibility, and qualification. These terms are defined in a limited technical sense applicable to the evaluation of simulation models, and not as general philosophical concepts. Different tests and standards are applied to the operational, theoretical, and data components. The operational and data components can be validated; the theoretical component cannot. The most common problem with ecological and environmental models is failure to state what the validation criteria are. Criteria must be explicitly stated because there are no universal standards for selecting what test procedures or criteria to use for validation. A test based on comparison of simulated versus observed data is generally included whenever possible. Because the objective and subjective components of validation are not mutually exclusive, disagreements over the meaning of validation can only be resolved by establishing a convention.},

@article{meng_responses_2015,
	Abstract = {Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) typically rely on plant functional types (PFTs), which are assigned distinct environmental tolerances and replace one another progressively along environmental gradients. Fixed values of traits are assigned to each PFT; modelled trait variation along gradients is thus driven by PFT replacement. But empirical studies have revealed "universal" scaling relationships (quantitative trait variations with climate that are similar within and between species, PFTs and communities); and continuous, adaptive trait variation has been proposed to replace PFTs as the basis for next-generation DGVMs.
 Here we analyse quantitative leaf-trait variation on long temperature and moisture gradients in China with a view to understanding the relative importance of PFT replacement vs. continuous adaptive variation within PFTs. Leaf area (LA), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and nitrogen content of dry matter were measured on all species at 80 sites ranging from temperate to tropical climates and from dense forests to deserts. Chlorophyll fluorescence traits and carbon, phosphorus and potassium contents were measured at 47 sites. Generalized linear models were used to relate log-transformed trait values to growing-season temperature and moisture indices, with or without PFT identity as a predictor, and to test for differences in trait responses among PFTs.
 Continuous trait variation was found to be ubiquitous. Responses to moisture availability were generally similar within and between PFTs, but biophysical traits (LA, SLA and LDMC) of forbs and grasses responded differently from woody plants. SLA and LDMC responses to temperature were dominated by the prevalence of evergreen PFTs with thick, dense leaves at the warm end of the gradient. Nutrient (N, P and K) responses to climate gradients were generally similar within all PFTs. Area-based nutrients generally declined with moisture; Narea and Karea declined with temperature, but Parea increased with temperature.
 Although the adaptive nature of many of these trait-climate relationships is understood qualitatively, a key challenge for modelling is to predict them quantitatively. Models must take into account that community-level responses to climatic gradients can be influenced by shifts in PFT composition, such as the replacement of deciduous by evergreen trees, which may run either parallel or counter to trait variation within PFTs. The importance of PFT shifts varies among traits, being important for biophysical traits but less so for physiological and chemical traits. Finally, models should take account of the diversity of trait values that is found in all sites and PFTs, representing the "pool" of variation that is locally available for the natural adaptation of ecosystem function to environmental change.},

@article{andrade_regulation_1998,
	Abstract = {We studied regulation of whole-tree water use in individuals of five diverse canopy tree species growing in a Panamanian seasonal forest. A construction crane equipped with a gondola was used to access the upper crowns and points along the branches and trunks of the study trees for making concurrent measurements of sap flow at the whole-tree and branch levels, and vapor phase conductances and water status at the leaf level. These measurements were integrated to assess physiological regulation of water use from the whole-tree to the single-leaf scale. Whole-tree water use ranged from 379 kg day−1 in a 35 m-tall Anacardium excelsum tree to 46 kg day−1 in an 18 m-tall Cecropia longipes tree. The dependence of whole-tree and branch sap velocity and sap flow on sapwood area was essentially identical in the five trees studied. However, large differences in transpiration per unit leaf area (E) among individuals and among branches on the same individual were observed. These differences were substantially reduced when E was normalized by the corresponding branch leaf area:sapwood area ratio (LA/SA). Variation in stomatal conductance (g s) and crown conductance (g c), a total vapor phase conductance that includes stomatal and boundary layer components, was closely associated with variation in the leaf area-specific total hydraulic conductance of the soil/leaf pathway (G t). Vapor phase conductance in all five trees responded similarly to variation in G t. Large diurnal variations in G t were associated with diurnal variation in exchange of water between the transpiration stream and internal stem storage compartments. Differences in stomatal regulation of transpiration on a leaf area basis appeared to be governed largely by tree size and hydraulic architectural features rather than physiological differences in the responsiveness of stomata. We suggest that reliance on measurements gathered at a single scale or inadequate range of scale may result in misleading conclusions concerning physiological differences in regulation of transpiration.},

The JWA dataset was derived from a high-density weather station network with adjacent stations about 17-21 km apart and served as our high quality climate data. The original NCAR dataset (about 0.9degrees x 0.9degrees) was resampled at 1 km x 1 km resolution using the bilinear interpolation method and served as our "poor" quality data source. We found that, on average, the NCAR dataset underestimated the 1998 NPP by 15\% over the whole study area compared with the JWA dataset, by 21\% in needle forest, by 18\% in grass/cereal-cropland, by 14\% in broadleaf forest, by 11\% in broadleaf crops, and by 2\% in shrubs. However, the NCAR dataset slightly overestimated NPP by 1\% in savannas in comparison with the JWA dataset. We also found that using the NCAR temperature data (daily maximum and minimum temperatures), specific humidity, and precipitation underestimated regional NPP by 17, 7, and 2\%, respectively, compared with the JWA dataset. However, using the NCAR global solar radiation did not significantly change the estimate of NPP although the NCAR solar radiation was much greater than the JWA solar radiation. By using a new sensitivity analysis technique called the Extension of Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (EFAST), we found that the required accuracy for the 1998 growing season was +/-2.9degreesC for daily maximum temperature, +/-2.0degreesC for daily minimum temperature, +/-2.5 MJ/m(2) per day for daily global solar radiation, and +/-3.4 g/kg for daily specific humidity to estimate NPP with an overall confidence coefficient of 95\% in the Hokkaido Island. The analytical approach developed in this study can also be applied to other input variables/parameters and other ecosystem models. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Data were compiled consisting of 1240 observations (614 species) from 83 different experiments published in 37 different studies, in order to quantify the relative importance of net assimilation rate (NAR, g cm(-2) day(-1)), specific leaf area (SLA, cm(2) g(-1)) and leaf mass ratio (LMR, g g(-1)) in determining relative growth rate (RGR, g g(-1) day(-1)), and how these change with respect to daily quantum input (DQI, moles m(-2) day(-1)) and growth form (herbaceous or woody). 2. Each of 1n(NAR), ln(SLA) and ln(LMR) were separately regressed on ln(RGR) using mixed model regressions in order to partition the between-experiment and within-experiment variation in slopes and intercepts. DQI and plant type were then added to these models to see if they could explain some of the between-experiment variation in the relative importance of each growth component. 3. LMR was never strongly related to RGR. In general, NAR was the best general predictor of variation in RGR. However, for determining RGR the importance of NAR decreased, and the importance of SLA increased, with decreasing daily quantum input in experiments containing herbaceous species. This did not occur in experiments involving woody species.},

	Abstract = {Disturbance-induced tree mortality is a key factor regulating the carbon balance of a forest, but tree mortality and its subsequent effects are poorly represented processes in terrestrial ecosystem models. It is thus unclear whether models can robustly simulate moderate (non-catastrophic) disturbances, which tend to increase biological and structural complexity and are increasingly common in aging US forests. We tested whether three forest ecosystem models -- Biome-BGC (BioGeochemical Cycles), a classic big-leaf model, and the ZELIG and ED (Ecosystem Demography) gap-oriented models -- could reproduce the resilience to moderate disturbance observed in an experimentally manipulated forest (the Forest Accelerated Succession Experiment in northern Michigan, USA, in which 38\% of canopy dominants were stem girdled and compared to control plots). Each model was parameterized, spun up, and disturbed following similar protocols and run for 5 years post-disturbance. The models replicated observed declines in aboveground biomass well. Biome-BGC captured the timing and rebound of observed leaf area index (LAI), while ZELIG and ED correctly estimated the magnitude of LAI decline. None of the models fully captured the observed post-disturbance C fluxes, in particular gross primary production or net primary production (NPP). Biome-BGC NPP was correctly resilient but for the wrong reasons, and could not match the absolute observational values. ZELIG and ED, in contrast, exhibited large, unobserved drops in NPP and net ecosystem production. The biological mechanisms proposed to explain the observed rapid resilience of the C cycle are typically not incorporated by these or other models. It is thus an open question whether most ecosystem models will simulate correctly the gradual and less extensive tree mortality characteristic of moderate disturbances.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere steadily increases as a consequence of anthropogenic emissions but with large interannual variability caused by the terrestrial biosphere. These variations in the CO2 growth rate are caused by large-scale climate anomalies but the relative contributions of vegetation growth and soil decomposition is uncertain. We use a biogeochemical model of the terrestrial biosphere to differentiate the effects of temperature and precipitation on net primary production (NPP) and heterotrophic respiration (Rh) during the two largest anomalies in atmospheric CO2 increase during the last 25 years. One of these, the smallest atmospheric year-to-year increase (largest land carbon uptake) in that period, was caused by global cooling in 1992/93 after the Pinatubo volcanic eruption. The other, the largest atmospheric increase on record (largest land carbon release), was caused by the strong El Nino event of 1997/98.RESULTS:We find that the LPJ model correctly simulates the magnitude of terrestrial modulation of atmospheric carbon anomalies for these two extreme disturbances. The response of soil respiration to changes in temperature and precipitation explains most of the modelled anomalous CO2 flux.CONCLUSION:Observed and modelled NEE anomalies are in good agreement, therefore we suggest that the temporal variability of heterotrophic respiration produced by our model is reasonably realistic. We therefore conclude that during the last 25 years the two largest disturbances of the global carbon cycle were strongly controlled by soil processes rather then the response of vegetation to these large-scale climatic events.},

	Abstract = {This paper is concerned with the analysis of non-standard bifurcations in piecewise smooth (PWS) dynamical systems. These systems are particularly relevant in many areas of engineering and applied science and have been shown to exhibit a large variety of nonlinear phenomena including chaos. While there is a complete understanding of local bifurcations for smooth dynamical systems, there is an urgent need for a complete theory regarding bifurcations in PWS systems. Although it is often claimed in the Western literature that no such theory exists, an analytical Framework to describe these bifurcations appeared in the Russian literature in the early Seventies, when Mark Feigin published his pioneering work on the analysis of C-bifurcations (also known as border-collision bifurcations) in n-dimensional PWS systems. Our aim is to bring his results in a more complete Form to a wider audience while putting them in the context of modern bifurcation analysis. First, a typical C-bifurcation scenario is described. Then, an appropriate local map is derived and used to derive a set of elementary conditions describing the possible consequences of a C-bifurcation. This set of conditions is finally used to classify all the possible codimension one C-bifurcations in a general class of PWS systems. The method presented is then applied to the case of a two-dimensional map and used to obtain a complete mapping of its parameter space. The possibility of a sudden jump to a chaotic attractor at a C-bifurcation is also illustrated in the case of a one-dimensional map. Finally. the method is applied to a set of first-order ordinary differential equations, and the results compared with numerical simulations, which graphically illustrate the wide range of possible behaviours in PWS systems.

	Abstract = {A large research program in the Australian monsoon tropics has concluded that monsoon rainforests have expanded within the savanna matrix, a trend that has been emulated throughout the tropics worldwide. The driver of the northern Australian trend was not resolved, but it was suggested to be linked to a long-term trend towards wetter climates, atmospheric CO(2) enrichment, and changed fire regimes. We review these findings with particular consideration of its analytical and evidentiary basis and plausibility of the global change hypothesis. Field validation has largely demonstrated that the aerial photographic technique that underpinned the previous research is reliable enough to detect rainforest expansion. Statistical modelling demonstrated that the expansion is related to sites with regionally low fire activity, although models are of low explanatory power reflecting the sketchy historical records of fire and feral animal impacts. Field studies show that current fire regimes adjacent to expanding rainforest patches are causing populations of the native conifer Callitris intratropica, an obligate seeder, to crash. Therefore, it is unlikely that changes in fire regimes, which have been deleterious to other fire-sensitive taxa and plant communities in the region, are responsible for the rainforest expansion. We conclude that the expansion of monsoon rainforests is most plausibly linked to the current wetting trend or elevated CO(2) concentration. Increases in either water availability or CO(2) concentration can potentially overwhelm the negative feedback between fire and rainforest cover that is responsible for the meta-stability of monsoon rainforest boundaries. However, further research at the continental scale, using aerial photography, tree rings and other proxies, is required to evaluate this hypothesis.},

	Abstract = {Recent IPCC projections suggest that Africa will be subject to particularly severe changes in atmospheric conditions. How the vegetation of Africa and particularly the grassland--savanna--forest complex will respond to these changes has rarely been investigated. Most studies on global carbon cycles use vegetation models that do not adequately account for the complexity of the interactions that shape the distribution of tropical grasslands, savannas and forests. This casts doubt on their ability to reliably simulate the future vegetation of Africa. We present a new vegetation model, the adaptive dynamic global vegetation model (aDGVM) that was specifically developed for tropical vegetation. The aDGVM combines established components from existing DGVMs with novel process-based and adaptive modules for phenology, carbon allocation and fire within an individual-based framework. Thus, the model allows vegetation to adapt phenology, allocation and physiology to changing environmental conditions and disturbances in a way not possible in models based on fixed functional types. We used the model to simulate the current vegetation patterns of Africa and found good agreement between model projections and vegetation maps. We simulated vegetation in absence of fire and found that fire suppression strongly influences tree dominance at the regional scale while at a continental scale fire suppression increases biomass in vegetation by a more modest 13\%. Simulations under elevated temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentrations predicted longer growing periods, higher allocation to roots, higher fecundity, more biomass and a dramatic shift toward tree dominated biomes. Our analyses suggest that the CO2 fertilization effect is not saturated at ambient CO2 levels and will strongly increase in response to further increases in CO2 levels. The model provides a general and flexible framework for describing vegetation response to the interactive effects of climate and disturbances.},

@article{knorr_long-term_2005,
	Abstract = {The sensitivity of soil carbon to warming is a major uncertainty in projections of carbon dioxide concentration and climate(1). Experimental studies overwhelmingly indicate increased soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition(2-8) at higher temperatures, resulting in increased carbon dioxide emissions from soils. However, recent findings have been cited as evidence against increased soil carbon emissions in a warmer world(9,10). In soil warming experiments, the initially increased carbon dioxide efflux returns to pre-warming rates within one to three years(10-14), and apparent carbon pool turnover times are insensitive to temperature(15). It has already been suggested that the apparent lack of temperature dependence could be an artefact due to neglecting the extreme heterogeneity of soil carbon(16), but no explicit model has yet been presented that can reconcile all the above findings. Here we present a simple three-pool model that partitions SOC into components with different intrinsic turnover rates. Using this model, we show that the results of all the soil-warming experiments are compatible with long-term temperature sensitivity of SOC turnover: they can be explained by rapid depletion of labile SOC combined with the negligible response of non-labile SOC on experimental timescales. Furthermore, we present evidence that non-labile SOC is more sensitive to temperature than labile SOC, implying that the long-term positive feedback of soil decomposition in a warming world may be even stronger than predicted by global models(1,17-20).},

Moreover, the two classical routes to chaos, namely, torus destruction and cascade of period doublings, are numerically detected. Since in the case of constant parameters the model cannot have multiple attractors, catastrophes and chaos, the results support the conjecture that seasons can very easily give rise to complex population dynamics.},

	Abstract = {A model to simulate the ecological processes of tree growth, mortality and recruitment, and the processes of forest management, in the terra firme forests of the eastern Amazon is described. It is implemented within the SYMFOR (http://www.symfor.org) framework. It is based on measurements of all trees that have a diameter greater than 5 cm from experimental plots in the Jari Cellulose and Tapajos National Forest areas over a 16-year period. Ten species groups are used to describe the natural processes affecting tree behaviour. Growth rates are calculated for each species group using the tree diameter and a competition index. Mortality and recruitment are simulated as stochastic processes. Recruitment probability is based on the predicted growth rate of a hypothetical tree. Options exist to vary the human interaction with the forest reflecting forest management decisions, as for other SYMFOR models. Model evaluation compares the performance of the model with data describing forest recovery for 16 years following logging. The model was applied to simulate current forest management practice in the Brazilian Amazon, with 40 m(3) ha(-1) of timber extracted with a cutting cycle of 30 years. Results show that yields are sustained for three harvests following the first logging of primary forest, but that the composition of timber moves towards lightwooded species rather than hardwooded. The predicted size of extracted trees decreases and the number of trees extracted increases with successive harvests, leading to a prediction of increased costs and lower profits for the logging company despite constant yields. The standing volume of all trees just before harvest is reduced by 15\% over 150 years, with pioneer species becoming increasingly prevalent in the stand. The model, in the SYMFOR framework, can be used to help understand the differences between alternative forest management strategies in the Brazilian Amazon. Such knowledge is required to improve forest management, regulation and certification, and help to conserve the worlds largest remaining tropical forest. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Climatic outputs from the atmospheric general circulation model ECHAM4 coupled to a mixed layer ocean model are used as inputs to the CARAIB global vegetation model to reconstruct the distribution of vegetation and the biosphere carbon stocks over the continents during the Late Miocene (Tortonian). The results show significant changes in the geographical distribution of vegetation during the Late Miocene compared to the present with a reduction of desert areas and an expansion of tropical seasonal forests, which reached temperate latitudes. These changes in vegetation distribution are accompanied by a moderate increase of the total biosphere carbon stock by 159Gt. Sensitivity tests to atmospheric CO(2) have also been performed with the vegetation model only, i.e., while keeping constant all climatic variables to their reference Tortonian state. These tests point out the potential importance Of CO(2) fertilization both regarding vegetation distribution and biosphere carbon storage. The impact of an atmospheric CO(2) decrease (from 280 to 200ppmv) or increase (from 280 to 560ppmv) on the vegetation distribution appears to be at least as large as that of the climate change between the Tortonian and the present, while in terms of carbon storage the impact of atmospheric CO(2) is far much larger than the climatic one. Although the actual response of vegetation to CO(2) fertilization may be much smaller than its theoretical response in the model, these results emphasize the need to consider atmospheric CO(2) as an important parameter for palaeovegetation reconstructions.

Despite some exceptions, case studies, examined by trade-offs between reproduction and other life-history traits, generally support the predictions of the cost of reproduction hypothesis. The cost of reproduction as an evolutionary determinant of sexual dimorphism in life history traits in dioecious species was specifically tested, considering that the higher cost of reproduction in females has driven the life history traits related to sexual dimorphism. Females of woody dioecious species were consistently smaller than males supporting the costs of reproduction hypothesis. By contrast, females of herbaceous perennials were generally the larger sex, which did not fit the expectations of the hypothesis. Finally, the mechanisms that enable the compensation of the reproductive costs are detailed, including the plastic responses of photosynthesis and growth, the effects of the timing of investment, plant architecture and plant physiological integration.},

Pollen data were grouped into mega-biomes to facilitate the comparison between the different records. Most tropical African records do not appear to register Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) variability, although there are vegetation changes during Heinrich Stadials (HS). There is a stronger signal of D-O and HS variability in the South American records. Records close to the modern northern and southern limits of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) show opposite trends in vegetation development during HS and D-O cycles. The pollen data from tropical South America corroborate the hypothesis of a southward shift in the migration pattern of the ITCZ and a reduction in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) during HS.

To investigate ecosystem service supply during the 21st century, we used a range of ecosystem models and scenarios of climate and land-use change to conduct a Europe-wide assessment. Large changes in climate and land use typically resulted in large changes in ecosystem service supply. Some of these trends may be positive (for example, increases in forest area and productivity) or offer opportunities (for example, "surplus land" for agricultural extensification and bioenergy production). However, many changes increase vulnerability as a result of a decreasing supply of ecosystem services (for example, declining soil fertility, declining water availability, increasing risk of forest fires), especially in the Mediterranean and mountain regions.},

	Abstract = {Though dichogamy is generally interpreted as a means of preventing self-fertilization, the efficiency of this mechanism has been questioned. Little attention has been paid to functional aspects of male/female timing, such as variation over time in pollen germinability and in stigma receptivity. In the present study these aspects of male/female timing were investigated in the protandrous speciesSalvia verbenaca. To evaluate the effects of selfing, fruit set, total seed weight produced and seed/ovule ratio were also determined, (a) following artificial crossing, (b) following selfing (i.e. bagging) and (c) under natural conditions. Both pollen germinability and stigma receptivity peaked on the last day (day 3) of the flower's life, which presumably favours selfing. Neither fruit set nor seed/ovule ratio were significantly affected by pollination regime, but the total seed weight produced by artificially crossed plants was significantly higher than that produced by bagged or untreated plants. Neither fruit set, seed/ovule ratio nor total seed weight differed significantly between the two years of study. Thus, if aS. verbenaca flower receives outcrossing pollen it will produce a greater weight of seeds (with consequent advantages in terms of female reproductive success). However, the peaking of both pollen germinability and stigma receptivity on day 3 of the flower's life means that selfing is likely to occur if outcrossing pollen has not been received over the early part of the flower's life.},

	Abstract = {The concept of sustainability, an abstract one by its nature, has been given a mathematical representation through the use of Fisher information as a measure. It is used to propose the sustainability hypotheses for dynamical systems, which has paved the way to achieve sustainable development through externally enforced control schemes. For natural systems, this refers to the task of ecosystem management, which is complicated due the lack of clear objectives. This work attempts to incorporate the idea of sustainability in ecosystem management. The natural regulation of ecosystems suggests two possible control options, top-down control and bottom-up control. A comparison of these two control philosophies is made on generic food chain models using the objectives derived from the sustainability hypotheses. Optimal control theory is used to derive the control profiles to handle the complex nature of the models and the objectives. The results indicate a strong relationship between the hypotheses and the dynamic behavior of the models, supporting the use of Fisher information as a measure. As regards to ecosystem management, it has been observed that top-down control is more aggressive but can result in instability, while bottom-up control is guaranteed to give a stable and improved dynamic response. The results also indicate that bottom-up control is a better option to affect shifts in the dynamic regimes of a system, which may be required to recover the system from a natural disaster like the hurricane Katrina.

We present our efforts at constructing a theory from Information Theory and Ecological Models. We discuss the state of complex systems that incorporate ecological and other components in terms of dynamic behavior in a phase space defined by the system state variables. From sampling the system trajectory, a distribution function for the probability of observing the system in a given state is constructed, and an expression for the Fisher information is derived. Fisher information is the maximum amount of information available from a set of observations. in this case, states of the system. Fisher information is a function of the variability of the observations such that low variability leads to high Fisher information and high variability leads to low Fisher information. Systems in stable dynamic states have constant Fisher information. Systems losing organization migrate toward higher variability and lose Fisher information. Self-organizing systems decrease their variability and acquire Fisher information. These considerations lead us to propose a sustainability hypothesis: "sustainable systems do not lose or gain Fisher information over time." We illustrate these concepts using simulated ecological systems in stable and unstable states, and we discuss the underlying dynamics. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{jackson_belowground_2000,
	Abstract = {The extent and consequences of global land-cover and land-use change are increasingly apparent. One consequence not so apparent is the altered structure of plants belowground. This paper examines such belowground changes, emphasizing the interaction of altered root distributions with other factors and their treatment in models. Shifts of woody and herbaceous vegetation with deforestation, afforestation, and woody plant encroachment typically alter the depth and distribution of plant roots, influencing soil nutrients, the water balance, and net primary productivity (NPP). For example, our analysis of global soil data sets shows that the major plant nutrients C, N, P, and K are more shallowly distributed than are Ca, Mg, and Na, but patterns for each element vary with the dominant vegetation type. After controlling for climate, soil C and N are distributed more deeply in arid shrublands than in arid grasslands, and subhumid forests have shallower nutrient distributions than do subhumid grasslands. Consequently, changes in vegetation may influence the distribution of soil carbon and nutrients over time (perhaps decades to centuries). Shifts in the water balance are typically much more rapid. Catchment studies indicate that the water yield decreases 25--40 mm for each 10\% increase in tree cover, and increases in transpiration of water taken up by deep roots may account for as much as 50\% of observed responses. Because models are increasingly important for predicting the consequences of vegetation change, we discuss the treatment of belowground processes and how different treatments affect model outputs. Whether models are parameterized by biome or plant life form (or neither), use single or multiple soil layers, or include N and water limitation will all affect predicted outcomes. Acknowledging and understanding such differences should help constrain predictions of vegetation change.},

	Abstract = {Abstract:We developed three black bear ( Ursus americanus) habitat models in the context of a geographic information system to identify linkage areas across a major transportation corridor. One model was based on empirical habitat data, and the other two (opinion- and literature-based) were based on expert information developed in a multicriteria decision-making process. We validated the performance of the models with an independent data set. Four classes of highway linkage zones were generated. Class 3 linkages were the most accurate for mapping cross-highway movement. Our tests showed that the model based on expert literature most closely approximated the empirical model, both in the results of statistical tests and the description of the class 3 linkages. In addition, the expert literature--based model was consistently more similar to the empirical model than either of two seasonal, expert opinion--based models. Among the expert models, the literature-based model had the strongest correlation with the empirical model. Expert-opinion models were less in agreement with the empirical model. The poor performance of the expert-opinion model may be explained by an overestimation of the importance of riparian habitat by experts compared with the literature. A small portion of the empirical data to test the models was from the pre-berry season and may have affected how well the model predicted linkage areas. Our empirical and expert models represent useful tools for resource and transportation planners charged with determining the location of mitigation passages for wildlife when baseline information is lacking and when time constraints do not allow for data collection before construction.},

	Abstract = {This opportunistic study compares the vegetation, fuel loads and vertebrate fauna of part of a 120-ha block of tropical open forest protected from fire for 23 years, and an adjacent block burnt annually over this period. Total fuel loads did not differ significantly between the unburnt and annually burnt sites, but their composition was markedly different, with far less grassy fuel, but far more litter fuel, in the unburnt block. There were major differences between treatments in the composition of trees and shrubs, manifest particularly in the number of stems. There was no overall difference in plant species richness between the two treatments, but richness of woody species was far higher in the unburnt treatment, and of annual and perennial grasses, and perennial herbs in the annually burnt treatment. Change in plant species composition from annually burnt to unburnt treatment was directional, in that there was a far higher representation of rainforest-associated species (with the percentage of woody stems attributable to 'rainforest' species increasing from 24\% of all species in the annually burnt treatment to 43\% in the unburnt treatment, that of basal area from 9\% to 30\%, that of species richness from 8\% to 17\%, and that of cover from 12 to 47\%). The vertebrate species composition varied significantly between treatments, but there was relatively little difference in species richness (other than for a slightly richer reptile fauna in the unburnt treatment). Again, there was a tendency for species that were more common in the unburnt treatment to be rainforest-associated species. The results from this study suggest that there is a sizeable and distinct set of species that are associated with relatively long-unburnt environments, and hence that are strongly disadvantaged under contemporary fire regimes. We suggest that such species need to be better accommodated by fire management through strategic reductions in the frequency of burning.},

	Abstract = {Size-related changes in hydraulic architecture, carbon allocation and gas exchange of Sclerolobium paniculatum (Leguminosae), a dominant tree species in Neotropical savannas of central Brazil (Cerrado), were investigated to assess their potential role in the dieback of tall individuals. Trees greater than similar to 6-m-tall exhibited more branch damage, larger numbers of dead individuals, higher wood density, greater leaf mass per area, lower leaf area to sapwood area ratio (LA/SA), lower stomatal conductance and lower net CO2 assimilation than small trees. Stem-specific hydraulic conductivity decreased, while leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity remained nearly constant, with increasing tree size because of lower LA/SA in larger trees. Leaves were substantially more vulnerable to embolism than stems. Large trees had lower maximum leaf hydraulic conductance (K-leaf) than small trees and all tree sizes exhibited lower K-leaf at midday than at dawn. These size-related adjustments in hydraulic architecture and carbon allocation apparently incurred a large physiological cost: large trees received a lower return in carbon gain from their investment in stem and leaf biomass compared with small trees. Additionally, large trees may experience more severe water deficits in dry years due to lower capacity for buffering the effects of hydraulic path-length and soil water deficits.},

	Abstract = {Self-thinning dynamics were examined in a natural, 120-year, insect-mediated balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) chronosequence in the humid boreal forests of western Newfoundland. The well-developed chronosequence representing the classic stages of stand development provided a unique opportunity to quantify balsam fir self-thinning dynamics and to independently test a first approximation stand density management diagram developed for mixed balsam fir-black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) stands in western Newfoundland. A slope of -1.28 for the self-thinning tree volume-density line (as determined by reduced major axis) was significantly different than the theoretical self-thinning slope of -1.5. This compared very well with other self-thinning studies in Abies stands. Older stands judged as non-self-thinning had a shallower slope approaching unity. The mixed fir-spruce stand density management diagram was found to be a good reflection of stand dynamics and may act as an effective operational tool in tree density management. Balsam fir began to self-thin at 75 percentile heights of 7 m, 60 years of age and stem densities approaching 31,000 stems ha-1. Balsam fir ceased self-thinning in 90 year-old stands, with tree heights {\textgreater} 15 m and stem densities {\textless} 3000 stems ha. The relative accumulation of live and dead basal area across the chronosequence was best explained by the relative contribution of insect herbivory, self-thinning and density-independent mortality to tree death. The relative proportion of dead basal area declined steadily from a high of 80\% in the youngest stands to a low of 20\% in the 60-year-old stands, increasing to levels not exceeding 30\% in the oldest stands. Stand break-up associated with the onset of density-independent tree mortality occurred in stands approaching 90 years of age.},

This particular spontaneous arrangement of the vegetation optimizes the use of the scarce water resources and could be imitated to restore vulnerable ecosystems; at the same time, the patterns of vegetation act as an early warning signal of the fact that fragile ecosystems may suddenly undergo irreversible shifts, thus, they deserve a special attention. The formation of vegetation patterns is the object of many theoretical and experimental studies, nevertheless, in previous works, the interest that is deserved to below ground biomass allocation is minor as compared to the effort that is spent to describe the organization of vegetation above ground. A simple model for the study of vegetation patterns in arid lands has been used here to investigate the interrelations between plant ecology and hydrology, and the interplay between above and below ground mass patterns. The results of the numerical simulations that are reported and discussed hereinafter, have been obtained by postulating different biomass growth rates and root density distributions, under water stress. By so doing, the impact of root architecture on patterns of above ground biomass with different survival strategy has been demonstrated.},

In the past decades, several new approaches have been applied to the fossil record of grasses to elucidate the patterns and processes of this ecosystem transformation. The data indicate that the development of grassland ecosystems on most continents was a multistage process involving the Paleogene appearance of (C(3) and C(4)) open-habitat grasses, the mid-late Cenozoic spread of C(3) grass-dominated habitats, and, finally, the Late Neogene expansion of C(4) grasses at tropical-subtropical latitudes. The evolution of herbivores adapted to grasslands did not necessarily coincide with the spread of open-habitat grasses. In addition, the timing of these evolutionary and ecological events varied between regions. Consequently, region-by-region investigations using both direct (plant fossils) and indirect (e.g., stable carbon isotopes, faunas) evidence are required for a full understanding of the tempo and mode of grass and grassland evolution.},

The models represent changes in the probability of fire as a function of time since last fire. Despite considerable differences in the probability distributions of fire intervals, the models generate very similar age distributions when the mean fire interval is the same. Therefore, fitting the theoretical distributions to observed landscape age structure is unlikely to allow discrimination between different models. Previously, the most commonly used models of fire intervals have been based on the Weibull probability distribution. We believe that this is unnecessarily restrictive, and a broader range of models should be considered. The models may be based on an a priori understanding of the ecosystem being studied. They should assist interpretation of observed or inferred fire interval distributions.},

In other words. we establish a set of sufficient conditions under which increased stochasticity speeds up the extinction process independently of whether stochasticity is environmental or demographic. In this way, we are able to confirm that increased stochasticity is detrimental for population growth.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents the quantities of macro-nutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg and S) released from the ground layer vegetation to the atmosphere during six experimental burnings, in a Brazilian open savanna, named 'campo-cerrado'. The values were obtained by comparing the amounts of nutrients in the fuel and in the ash resulting after the burn, in three different seasons. On average, 20.6 kg of N, 1.6 kg of P, 7.1 kg of K, 12.1 kg of Ca, 3.0 kg of Mg, and 3.2 kg of S ha-1 were transferred from the plant biomass to the atmosphere, representing mean percentages of 95\% for N, 51\% for P, 44\% for K, 52\% for Ca, 42\% for Mg, and 59\% for S. The burn season showed no significant influence on the amounts of nutrients transferred to the atmosphere. Some relationships involving the quantities of macro-nutrients released, fuel moisture, the combustion efficiency during the burns, and the initial standing biomass in the area were also tested. Comparing the average output of macro-nutrients to the atmosphere obtained in this study with their inputs via rainfall, in the same area, it was estimated that three years would be an adequate interval between prescribed burnings for this campo-cerrado, to speed up nutrient recycling without impoverishing the system.},

@article{friedlingstein_climate-carbon_2006,
	Abstract = {Eleven coupled climate-carbon cycle models used a common protocol to study the coupling between climate change and the carbon cycle. The models were forced by historical emissions and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2 anthropogenic emissions of CO2 for the 1850-2100 time period. For each model, two simulations were performed in order to isolate the impact of climate change on the land and ocean carbon cycle, and therefore the climate feedback on the atmospheric CO2 concentration growth rate. There was unanimous agreement among the models that future climate change will reduce the efficiency of the earth system to absorb the anthropogenic carbon perturbation. A larger fraction of anthropogenic CO2 will stay airborne if climate change is accounted for. By the end of the twenty-first century, this additional CO2 varied between 20 and 200 ppm for the two extreme models, the majority of the models lying between 50 and 100 ppm. The higher CO2 levels led to an additional climate warming ranging between 0.1 degrees and 1.5 degrees C. All models simulated a negative sensitivity for both the land and the ocean carbon cycle to future climate. However, there was still a large uncertainty on the magnitude of these sensitivities. Eight models attributed most of the changes to the land, while three attributed it to the ocean. Also, a majority of the models located the reduction of land carbon uptake in the Tropics. However, the attribution of the land sensitivity to changes in net primary productivity versus changes in respiration is still subject to debate; no consensus emerged among the models.},

	Abstract = {Vegetation gradients developing around water sources (i.e. piospheres) are important features of arid and semi-arid ecosystems. Studied extensively in pastoral areas, piospheres have rarely been investigated in areas hosting rich herbivore diversity. We studied piospheres in woody cover assessed through remote-sensing in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, which has one of the world's largest elephant populations. As no preferred statistical model for piosphere studies has emerged, we first contrasted results from ordinary least-square (OLS) regressions on raw data with those from other statistical models (OLS on aggregated data and simultaneous autoregressive models on raw data), and selected the most parsimonious, unbiased, model to study the influence of artificial and natural waterholes, and the abundance of elephants, others browsers, and grazers on piospheres. OLS models provided unbiased parameter estimates, despite the strong spatial autocorrelation present in woody cover data, whereas other statistical models had important drawbacks. Using an OLS framework we showed that despite an important negative non-linear mean effect, distance-to-water was a poor predictor of woody cover at any location. Woody cover was on average more reduced in the vicinity of water at artificial waterholes than at natural waterholes. Elephant abundance was not consistently associated with lower woody cover, and poorly explained woody cover heterogeneity, as did all other herbivore-related variables. Our study indicates that piospheres may develop differently in pastoral and protected areas, suggesting the importance of herbivore diversity in ecosystem functioning. Our results also show that heterogeneity in woody cover persists within piospheres, calling for further investigation on the origin and role of this heterogeneity in the maintenance of ecological processes and biodiversity within these key-areas of the landscape.},

	Abstract = {An analysis of hydrologic variability in Colombia shows different seasonal effects associated with El Ni{\~n}o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. Spectral and cross-correlation analyses are developed between climatic indices of the tropical Pacific Ocean and the annual cycle of Colombia's hydrology: precipitation, river flows, soil moisture, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Our findings indicate stronger anomalies during December-February and weaker during March-May. The effects of ENSO are stronger for streamflow than for precipitation, owing to concomitant effects on soil moisture and evapotranspiration. We studied time variability of 10-day average volumetric soil moisture, collected at the tropical Andes of central Colombia at depths of 20 and 40 cm, in coffee growing areas characterized by shading vegetation (``shaded coffee''), forest, and sunlit coffee. The annual and interannual variability of soil moisture are highly intertwined for the period 1997--1999, during strong El Ni{\~n}o and La Ni{\~n}a events. Soil moisture exhibited greater negative anomalies during 1997--1998 El Ni{\~n}o, being strongest during the two dry seasons that normally occur in central Colombia. Soil moisture deficits were more drastic at zones covered by sunlit coffee than at those covered by forest and shaded coffee. Soil moisture responds to wetter than normal precipitation conditions during La Ni{\~n}a 1998--1999, reaching maximum levels throughout that period. The probability density function of soil moisture records is highly skewed and exhibits different kinds of multimodality depending upon land cover type. NDVI exhibits strong negative anomalies throughout the year during El Ni{\~n}os, in particular during September--November (year 0) and June--August (year 0). The strong negative relation between NDVI and El Ni{\~n}o has enormous implications for carbon, water, and energy budgets over the region, including the tropical Andes and Amazon River basin.},

Debate has centred on two views. The first explanation involves tradeoffs along a small number of axes, including 'colonization-competition', resource competition ( light, water, nitrogen for plants, including the 'successional niche'), and life history (e.g. high-light growth vs. low-light survival and few large vs. many small seeds). The second view is neutrality, which assumes that species differences do not contribute to dynamics. Clark et al. ( 2004) presented a third explanation, that coexistence is inherently high dimensional, but still depends on species differences. We demonstrate that neither traditional low-dimensional tradeoffs nor neutrality can resolve the biodiversity paradox, in part by showing that they do not properly interpret stochasticity in statistical and in theoretical models. Unless sample sizes are small, traditional data modelling assures that species will appear different in a few dimensions, but those differences will rarely predict coexistence when parameter estimates are plugged into theoretical models. Contrary to standard interpretations, neutral models do not imply functional equivalence, but rather subsume species differences in stochastic terms. New hierarchical modelling techniques for inference reveal high-dimensional differences among species that can be quantified with random individual and temporal effects ( RITES), i.e. process-level variation that results from many causes. We show that this variation is large, and that it stands in for species differences along unobserved dimensions that do contribute to diversity. High dimensional coexistence contrasts with the classical notions of tradeoffs along a few axes, which are often not found in data, and with 'neutral models', which mask, rather than eliminate, tradeoffs in stochastic terms. This mechanism can explain coexistence of species that would not occur with simple, low-dimensional tradeoff scenarios.},

	Abstract = {Savannas are known as ecosystems with tree cover below climate-defined equilibrium values. However, a predictive framework for understanding constraints on tree cover is lacking. We present (a) a spatially extensive analysis of tree cover and fire distribution in sub-Saharan Africa, and (b) a model, based on empirical results, demonstrating that savanna and forest may be alternative stable states in parts of Africa, with implications for understanding savanna distributions. Tree cover does not increase continuously with rainfall, but rather is constrained to low ({\textless}50\%, ``savanna'') or high tree cover ({\textgreater}75\%, ``forest''). Intermediate tree cover rarely occurs. Fire, which prevents trees from establishing, differentiates high and low tree cover, especially in areas with rainfall between 1000 mm and 2000 mm. Fire is less important at low rainfall ({\textless}1000 mm), where rainfall limits tree cover, and at high rainfall ({\textgreater}2000 mm), where fire is rare. This pattern suggests that complex interactions between climate and disturbance produce emergent alternative states in tree cover. The relationship between tree cover and fire was incorporated into a dynamic model including grass, savanna tree saplings, and savanna trees. Only recruitment from sapling to adult tree varied depending on the amount of grass in the system. Based on our empirical analysis and previous work, fires spread only at tree cover of 40\% or less, producing a sigmoidal fire probability distribution as a function of grass cover and therefore a sigmoidal sapling to tree recruitment function. This model demonstrates that, given relatively conservative and empirically supported assumptions about the establishment of trees in savannas, alternative stable states for the same set of environmental conditions (i.e., model parameters) are possible via a fire feedback mechanism. Integrating alternative stable state dynamics into models of biome distributions could improve our ability to predict changes in biome distributions and in carbon storage under climate and global change scenarios.},

@article{tilman_competition_1994,
	Abstract = {All organisms, especially terrestrial plants and other sessile species, interact mainly with their neighbors, but neighborhoods can differ in composition because of dispersal and mortality. There is increasingly strong evidence that the spatial structure created by these forces profoundly influences the dynamics, composition, and biodiversity of communities. Nonspatial models predict that no more consumer species can coexist at equilibrium than there are limiting resources. In contrast, a similar model that includes neighborhood competition and random dispersal among sites predicts stable coexistence of a potentially unlimited number of species on a single resource. Coexistence occurs because species with sufficiently high dispersal rates persist in sites not occupied by superior competitors. Coexistence requires limiting similarity and two-way or three-way interspecific trade-offs among competitive ability, colonization ability, and longevity. This spatial competition hypothesis seems to explain the coexistence of the numerous plant species that compete for a single limiting resource in the grasslands of Cedar Creek Natural History Area. It provides a testable, alternative explanation for other high diversity communities, such as tropical forests. The model can be tested (1) by determining if coexisting species have the requisite trade-offs in colonization, competition, and longevity, (2) by addition of propagules to determine if local species abundances are limited by dispersal, and (3) by comparisons of the effects on biodiversity of high rates of propagule addition for species that differ in competitive ability.},

	Abstract = {Patterns of tropical forest functional diversity express processes of ecological assembly at multiple geographic scales and aid in predicting ecological responses to environmental change. Tree canopy chemistry underpins forest functional diversity, but the interactive role of phylogeny and environment in determining the chemical traits of tropical trees is poorly known. Collecting and analyzing foliage in 2,420 canopy tree species across 19 forests in the western Amazon, we discovered (i) systematic, community-scale shifts in average canopy chemical traits along gradients of elevation and soil fertility; (ii) strong phylogenetic partitioning of structural and defense chemicals within communities independent of variation in environmental conditions; and (iii) strong environmental control on foliar phosphorus and calcium, the two rock-derived elements limiting CO2 uptake in tropical forests. These findings indicate that the chemical diversity of western Amazonian forests occurs in a regionally nested mosaic driven by long-term chemical trait adjustment of communities to large-scale environmental filters, particularly soils and climate, and is supported by phylogenetic divergence of traits essential to foliar survival under varying environmental conditions. Geographically nested patterns of forest canopy chemical traits will play a role in determining the response and functional rearrangement of western Amazonian ecosystems to changing land use and climate.},

Reciprocity is cognitively demanding, and both direct and indirect reciprocity require that individuals store information about the propensity of their partners to cooperate. By contrast, generalized reciprocity, wherein individuals help on the condition that they received help previously, only relies on whether an individual received help in a previous encounter. Such anonymous information makes generalized reciprocity hard to evolve in a well-mixed population, as the strategy will lose out to pure defectors. Here we analyze a model for the evolution of generalized reciprocity, incorporating assortment of encounters, to investigate the conditions under which it will evolve. We show that, in a well-mixed population, generalized reciprocity cannot evolve. However, incorporating assortment of encounters can favor the evolution of generalized reciprocity in which indiscriminate cooperation and defection are both unstable. We show that generalized reciprocity can evolve under both the prisoner's dilemma and the snowdrift game.},

Here we undertake a critical assessment of Australia's National Greenhouse Gas Inventory (NGGI) savanna burning emissions methodology. We describe the methodology developed for, and results and associated uncertainties derived from, a landscape-scale emissions abatement project in fire-prone western Arnhem Land, northern Australia. The methodology incorporates (i) detailed fire history and vegetation structure and fuels type mapping derived from satellite imagery; (ii) field-based assessments of fuel load accumulation, burning efficiencies (patchiness, combustion efficiency, ash retention) and N: C composition; and (iii) application of standard, regionally derived emission factors. Importantly, this refined methodology differs from the NGGI by incorporation of fire seasonality and severity components, and substantial improvements in baseline data. We consider how the application of a fire management program aimed at shifting the seasonality of burning (from one currently dominated by extensive late dry season wildfires to one where strategic fire management is undertaken earlier in the year) can provide significant project-based emissions abatement. The approach has wider application to fire-prone savanna systems dominated by anthropogenic sources of ignition.},

@article{cerling_expansion_1993,
	Abstract = {THE most common and the most primitive pathway of the three different photosynthetic pathways used by plants is the C3 pathway, or Calvin cycle, which is characterized by an initial CO2 carboxylation to form phosphoglyceric acid, a 3-carbon acid. The carbon isotope composition (deletaC-13) of C3 plants varies from about -23 to -35 parts per thousand1-3 and averages about -26 parts per thousand. Virtually all trees, most shrubs, herbs and forbs, and cool-season grasses and sedges use the C3 pathway. In the C4 pathway (Hatch-Slack cycle), CO2 initially combines with phosphoenol pyruvate to form the 4-carbon acids malate or aspartic acid, which are translocated to bundle sheath cells where CO2 is released and used in Calvin cycle reactions1-4. The carbon isotope composition of C4 plants ranges from about -10 to -14 parts per thousand, averaging about -13 parts per thousand for modern plants1-3. Warm-season grasses and sedges are the most abundant C4 plants, although C4 photosynthesis is found in about twenty families5. The third photosynthetic pathway, CAM, combines features of both C3 and C4 pathways. CAM plants, which include many succulents, have intermediate carbon isotope compositions and are also adapted to conditions of water and CO2 stress. The modern global ecosystem has a significant component of C4 plants, primarily in tropical savannas, temperate grasslands and semi-desert scrublands. Studies of palaeovegetation from palaeosols and palaeodiet from fossil tooth enamel indicate a rapid expansion of C4 biomass in both the Old World and the New World starting 7 to 5 million years ago. We propose that the global expansion of C4 biomass may be related to lower atmospheric carbon dioxide levels because C4 photosynthesis is favoured over C3 photosynthesis when there are low concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.},

Woody tissues are likely to face physiological, structural and defensive trade-offs. How a plant optimizes among these competing functions can have major ecological implications, which have been under-appreciated by ecologists compared to the focus they have given to leaf function. To draw together our current understanding of wood function, we identify and collate data on the major wood functional traits, including the largest wood density database to date (8412 taxa), mechanical strength measures and anatomical features, as well as clade-specific features such as secondary chemistry. We then show how wood traits are related to one another, highlighting functional trade-offs, and to ecological and demographic plant features (growth form, growth rate, latitude, ecological setting). We suggest that, similar to the manifold that tree species leaf traits cluster around the `leaf economics spectrum', a similar `wood economics spectrum' may be defined. We then discuss the biogeography, evolution and biogeochemistry of the spectrum, and conclude by pointing out the major gaps in our current knowledge of wood functional traits.},

Two drought-deciduous species, Brachychiton australis (Schott and Endl.) A. Terrace. and Cochlospermum gillivraei Benth., and two evergreen species, Alphitonia excelsa (Fenzal) Benth. and Austromyrtus bidwillii (Benth.) Burret. were studied. The deciduous species had higher specific leaf areas and maximum photosynthetic rates per leaf dry mass in the wet season than the evergreens. During the transition from wet season to dry season, total canopy area was reduced by 70-90\% in the deciduous species and stomatal conductance (g(s)) and assimilation rate (A) were markedly lower in the remaining leaves. Deciduous species maintained daytime leaf water potentials (Psi(L)) at close to or above wet season values by a combination of stomatal regulation and reduction in leaf area. Thus, the timing of leaf drop in deciduous species was not associated with large negative values of daytime Psi(L) (greater than -1.6 MPa) or predawn Psi(L) (greater than -1.0 MPa). The deciduous species appeared sensitive to small perturbations in soil and leaf water status that signalled the onset of drought. The evergreen species were less sensitive to the onset of drought and g(s) values were not significantly lower during the transitional period. In the dry season, the evergreen species maintained their canopies despite increasing water-stress; however, unlike Eucalyptus species from northern Australian savannas, A and g(s) were significantly lower than wet season values.},

	Abstract = {Tropical savannas cover a quarter of the Australian landmass and the biome represents a significant potential carbon sink. However, these savannas are subject to frequent and extensive fire. Fire regimes are likely to affect the productivity and carbon sequestration potential of savannas, through effects on both biomass and carbon emissions. The carbon sequestration potential has been estimated for some savanna sites by quantifying carbon storage in biomass and soil pools, and the fluxes to these pools. Using different techniques, previous work in these savannas has indicated that net ecosystem productivity [NEP, net primary productivity (NPP) less heterotrophic respiration] was about -3 t C ha(-1) y(-1) (i.e. a carbon sink). However, the impacts of fire were not accounted for in these calculations. Estimates of NEP have been combined with remotely-sensed estimates of area burnt and associated emissions for a an extensive area of mesic savanna in Arnhem Land, NT, Australia. Combining NEP estimates with precise fire data provides an estimate of net biome productivity (NBP), a production index that includes carbon loss through disturbance ( fire), and is thus a more realistic indicator of sequestration rate from this biome. This preliminary analysis suggests that NBP is approximately-1 t C ha(-1) y(-1) (i.e. a carbon sink). A reduction in the annual area burnt is likely to increase the sink size. Uncertainties surrounding these estimates of NBP and the implications of these uncertainties for land management in these extensive landscapes are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Accurate plant phenology (seasonal plant activity driven by environmental factors) models are vital tools for ecosystem simulation models and for predicting the response of ecosystems to climate change. Since the early 1970s, efforts have concentrated on predicting phenology of the temperate and boreal forests because they represent one-third of the carbon captured in plant ecosystems and they are the principal ecosystems with seasonal patterns of growth on Earth (one-fifth of the plant ecosystems area). Numerous phenological models have been developed to predict the growth timing of temperate or boreal trees. They are in general empirical, nonlinear and non-nested. For these reasons they are particularly difficult to fit, to test and to compare with each other. The methodological difficulties as well as the diversity of models used have greatly slowed down their improvement. The aim of this study was to show that the most widely used models simulating vegetative or reproductive phenology of trees are particular cases of a more general model. This unified model has three main advantages. First, it allows for a direct estimation of (i) the response of bud growth to either chilling or forcing temperatures and (ii) the periods when these temperatures affect the bud growth. Second, it can be simplified according to standard statistical tests for any particular species. Third, it provides a standardized framework for phenological models, which is essential for comparative studies as well as for robust model identification. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

	Abstract = {Extinction from habitat loss is the signature conservation problem of the twenty-first century(1). Despite its importance, estimating extinction rates is still highly uncertain because no proven direct methods or reliable data exist for verifying extinctions. The most widely used indirect method is to estimate extinction rates by reversing the species-area accumulation curve, extrapolating backwards to smaller areas to calculate expected species loss. Estimates of extinction rates based on this method are almost always much higher than those actually observed(2-5). This discrepancy gave rise to the concept of an 'extinction debt', referring to species 'committed to extinction' owing to habitat loss and reduced population size but not yet extinct during a non-equilibrium period(6,7). Here we show that the extinction debt as currently defined is largely a sampling artefact due to an unrecognized difference between the underlying sampling problems when constructing a species-area relationship (SAR) and when extrapolating species extinction from habitat loss. The key mathematical result is that the area required to remove the last individual of a species (extinction) is larger, almost always much larger, than the sample area needed to encounter the first individual of a species, irrespective of species distribution and spatial scale. We illustrate these results with data from a global network of large, mapped forest plots and ranges of passerine bird species in the continental USA; and we show that overestimation can be greater than 160\%. Although we conclude that extinctions caused by habitat loss require greater loss of habitat than previously thought, our results must not lead to complacency about extinction due to habitat loss, which is a real and growing threat.},

@article{van_nes_strategy_2005,
	Abstract = {Large models are commonly used for simulations of past results or future scenario's of ecosystems. However, such models have been criticized, mainly because the causes of their results are hard to understand. Simple models have contributed more to the development of ecological theory. However, simple models usually neglect important aspects such as spatial heterogeneity and individual variability, and may focus too much on one of several possible causes of a phenomenon. In this paper, we present a strategy that we have found useful for improving our understanding of the way in which complex models generate their results. The strategy consists of three phases. The first phase is a thorough analysis of the model behavior with respect to a selected set of parameters ('scrutinizing'). Secondly, similar analyses are done with several simplified versions of the model ('simplifying'). In this step, relationships between state variables or species that may potentially cause incomprehensible behavior are replaced by fixed values or highly simplified relations. The last step is to explain the differences between the full and the simplified versions and to discuss the results in the light of the existing ecological theory ('synthesizing'). We argue that this way of combining analyses of simple and more elaborate models is a powerful way to gain understanding of complex systems. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Periodic matrix population models are a useful approach to modelling cyclic variations in demographic rates. Caswell and Trevisan [1] introduced the perturbation analysis (sensitivities and elasticities) of the per-cycle population growth rate for such models. Although powerful, their method can be time-consuming when the dimension of the matrices is large or when cycles are composed of many phases. We present a more efficient method, based on a very simple matrix product. We compared the two methods for matrices of different sizes. We observed a reduction in calculation time on the order of 24\% with the new method for a set of 26 within-year Leslie matrices of size 287 x 287. The time saving may become particularly significant when sensitivities are used in Monte Carlo or bootstrap simulations. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {As the climate changes, drought may reduce tree productivity and survival across many forest ecosystems; however, the relative influence of specific climate parameters on forest decline is poorly understood. We derive a forest drought-stress index (FDSI) for the southwestern United States using a comprehensive tree-ring data set representing AD 1000--2007. The FDSI is approximately equally influenced by the warm-season vapour-pressure deficit (largely controlled by temperature) and cold-season precipitation, together explaining 82\% of the FDSI variability. Correspondence between the FDSI and measures of forest productivity, mortality, bark-beetle outbreak and wildfire validate the FDSI as a holistic forest-vigour indicator. If the vapour-pressure deficit continues increasing as projected by climate models, the mean forest drought-stress by the 2050s will exceed that of the most severe droughts in the past 1,000 years. Collectively, the results foreshadow twenty-first-century changes in forest structures and compositions, with transition of forests in the southwestern United States, and perhaps water-limited forests globally, towards distributions unfamiliar to modern civilization.},

	Abstract = {Fire shapes the distribution of savanna and forest through complex interactions involving climate, resources and species traits. Based on data from central Brazil, we propose that these interactions are governed by two critical thresholds. The fire-resistance threshold is reached when individual trees have accumulated sufficient bark to avoid stem death, whereas the fire-suppression threshold is reached when an ecosystem has sufficient canopy cover to suppress fire by excluding grasses. Surpassing either threshold is dependent upon long fire-free intervals, which are rare in mesic savanna. On high-resource sites, the thresholds are reached quickly, increasing the probability that savanna switches to forest, whereas low-resource sites are likely to remain as savanna even if fire is infrequent. Species traits influence both thresholds; saplings of savanna trees accumulate bark thickness more quickly than forest trees, and are more likely to become fire resistant during fire-free intervals. Forest trees accumulate leaf area more rapidly than savanna trees, thereby accelerating the transition to forest. Thus, multiple factors interact with fire to determine the distribution of savanna and forest by influencing the time needed to reach these thresholds. Future work should decipher multiple environmental controls over the rates of tree growth and canopy closure in savanna.},

@article{bellassen_modelling_2010,
	Abstract = {This article describes a new forest management module (FMM) that explicitly simulates forest stand growth and management within a process-based global vegetation model (GVM) called ORCHIDEE. The net primary productivity simulated by ORCHIDEE is used as an input to the FMM. The FMM then calculates stand and management characteristics such as stand density, tree size distribution, tree growth, the timing and intensity of thinnings and clear-cuts, wood extraction and litter generated after thinning. Some of these variables are then fed back to ORCHIDEE. These computations are made possible with a distribution-based modelling of individual tree size. The model derives natural mortality from the relative density index (rdi), a competition index based on tree size and stand density. Based on the common forestry management principle of avoiding natural mortality, a set of rules is defined to calculate the recurrent intensity and frequency of forestry operations during the stand lifetime. The new-coupled model is called ORCHIDEE-FM (forest management). The general behaviour of ORCHIDEE-FM is analysed for a broadleaf forest in north-eastern France. Flux simulation throughout a forest rotation compare well with the literature values, both in absolute values and dynamics. Results from ORCHIDEE-FM highlight the impact of forest management on ecosystem C-cycling, both in terms of carbon fluxes and stocks. In particular, the average net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of 225 gC m(-2) year(-1) is close to the biome average of 311 gCm(-2) year(-1). The NEP of the "unmanaged" case is 40\% lower, leading us to conclude that management explains 40\% of the cumulated carbon sink over 150 years. A sensitivity analysis reveals 4 major avenues for improvement: a better determination of initial conditions, an improved allocation scheme to explain age-related decline in productivity, and an increased specificity of both the self-thinning curve and the biomass-diameter allometry.

Better data about the historical behaviours of these dynamics are urgently needed. Such data are already available from ecology, archaeology, palaeontology and geology, but their integration into climate change research is hampered by differences in their temporal and geographical scales. One productive way to unite data across scales is the study of functional morphological traits, which can form a common denominator for studying interactions between species and climate across taxa, across ecosystems, across space and through time-an approach we call 'ecometrics'. The sampling methods that have become established in palaeontology to standardize over different scales can be synthesized with tools from community ecology and climate change biology to improve our understanding of the dynamics among species, ecosystems, climates and earth systems over time. Developing these approaches into an integrative climate change biology will help enrich our understanding of the changes our modern world is undergoing.},

@article{ito_simulation_2002,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we present a new model of the terrestrial carbon cycle (Sim-CYCLE), with the objectives of retrieving the carbon dynamics of various terrestrial ecosystems and estimating their response to global environmental change. The model can be characterized in three ways. (1) It is a compartment model. Ecosystem carbon storage is divided into five compartments; foliage, stem, root, litter, and mineral soil. This approach made the model simple and sound, and allowed us to run the model on a broad scale; indeed, the simulation in this paper was performed using data available at the global scale. (2) It is a process-based model. Sim-CYCLE estimates net primary production (NPP) and net ecosystem production (NEP) by explicitly calculating such carbon fluxes as gross primary production (GPP), plant respiration, and soil decomposition on a monthly time-step; these fluxes are regulated by a multitude of environmental factors at the physiological scale. In relation to global change, responses to increased atmospheric CO, and temperature should be modeled in a mechanistic manner. (3) It is a prognostic model. Sim-CYCLE is designed to be applicable not only to the simulation of an equilibrium state under given conditions, but also to the prediction of a transitional state under changing environmental conditions. Importantly, Sim-CYCLE is based on the dry-matter production theory, which enabled us to achieve the scaling-up from single-leaf to canopy and to conceptualize the growth process. Since the model includes both radiation and hydrological conditions, some indirect influences of the initial environmental change can be properly evaluated. We present a comprehensive model description and preliminary results confirmed at the plot scale: (1) intensively in four natural ecosystems and (2) extensively in global 21 sites. At each site, model parameters were calibrated to capture the observed carbon dynamics (e.g. productivity and carbon storage) at the equilibrium state. Successional growth patterns and seasonal variations in CO, exchange were also examined in a qualitative manner. Sim-CYCLE successfully expressed the differences between tropical forest and boreal forest and between humid forest and and grassland in terms of productivity and carbon storage. Next, we simulated transitional ecosystem carbon dynamics, in response to step-wise atmospheric CO, doubling and disturbance regime. The simulated temporal patterns of carbon cycle were realistic and ensured that Sim-CYCLE is an effective tool for predicting the impact of global change. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

@article{veenendaal_structural_2015,
	Abstract = {Through interpretations of remote-sensing data and/or theoretical propositions, the idea that forest and savanna represent "alternative stable states" is gaining increasing acceptance. Filling an observational gap, we present detailed stratified floristic and structural analyses for forest and savanna stands  located mostly within zones of transition (where both vegetation types occur in close proximity) in Africa, South America and Australia. Woody plant leaf area index variation was related to tree canopy cover in a similar way for both savanna and forest with substantial overlap between the two vegetation types. As total woody plant canopy cover increased, so did the relative contribution of middle and lower strata of woody vegetation. Herbaceous layer cover declined as woody cover increased. This pattern of understorey grasses and herbs progressively replaced by shrubs as the canopy closes over was found for both savanna and forests and on all continents. Thus, once subordinate woody canopy layers are taken into account, a less marked transition in woody plant cover across the savanna--forest-species discontinuum is observed compared to that inferred when trees of a basal diameter {\textgreater} 0.1 m are considered in isolation. This is especially the case for shrub-dominated savannas and in taller savannas approaching canopy closure. An  increased contribution of forest species to the total subordinate cover is also observed as savanna stand canopy closure occurs. Despite similarities in canopy-cover characteristics, woody vegetation in Africa and Australia attained greater heights and stored a greater amount of above-ground biomass than in South America. Up to three times as much above-ground biomass is stored in forests compared to savannas under equivalent climatic conditions. Savanna--forest transition zones were also found to typically occur at higher precipitation regimes for South America than for Africa. Nevertheless, consistent across all three continents coexistence was found to be confined to a well-defined edaphic--climate envelope  with soil and climate the key determinants of the relative location of forest and savanna stands. Moreover, when considered in conjunction with the appropriate water availability metrics, it emerges that soil exchangeable cations exert considerable control on woody canopy-cover extent as measured in our pan-continental (forest + savanna) data set. Taken together these observations do not lend support to the  notion of alternate stable states mediated through fire feedbacks as the prime force shaping the  distribution of the two dominant vegetation types of the tropical lands.},

The TTEE simulates an extended dry season in an eastern Amazonian rainforest, a plausible scenario if the El Ni{\~n}o phenomenon changes with climate change. The TTEE excludes 60\% of the wet season throughfall from a 1-ha plot (treatment), while the control 1-ha plot receives precipitation year-round. Mean percolation rate of the label peak in the control plot was greater than in the treatment plot during the wet season (0.75 vs. 0.07 m/mo). The rate was similar for both plots during the dry season (ca. 0.15 m/mo), indicative that both plots have similar topsoil structure. Interestingly, the label peak in the control plot during the dry season migrated upward an average distance of 64 cm. We show that water probably moved upward through soil pores---i.e., it did not involve roots (hydraulic lift)---most likely because of a favorable gradient of total (matric + gravitational) potential coupled with sufficient unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. Water probably also moved upward in the treatment plot, but was not detectable; the label in this plot did not percolate below 1 m or beyond the depth of plant water uptake. During the dry season, trees in the rainfall exclusion plot, regardless of species, consistently absorbed water significantly deeper, but never below 1.5--2 m, than trees in the control plot, and therefore may represent expected root function of this understory/subcanopy tree community during extended dry periods.},

	Abstract = {The African elephant is the largest extant terrestrial mammal and a reminder of the Pleistocene megafauna. Their survival is, however, dependent on conservation areas. In some conservation areas, rapidly growing elephant populations have led conservation biologists to ask, how many elephants can these areas support? The debate is polarized by arguments for large populations for economic, social, or ethical reasons and arguments for smaller populations that avoid biodiversity loss. We use a novel dynamic modeling approach to assess how climate change-induced vegetation change may influence the capacity of a conservation area to support large herbivores. The model projects that elephant densities and fire have substantial impacts on vegetation under current climatic conditions. Under future conditions, the capacity to support elephants increases due to CO2-induced increases in woody plant productivity. We conclude that sustainable management in conservation areas needs to be conditioned on the effects of climate change on vegetation.},

In this scale-explicit paradigm, savannas consist of patches in which a cyclical succession between woody and grassy dominance proceeds spatially asynchronously. The growing ecological and economic problem of shrub encroachment is a natural transient phase in this cycle. 2. An important step towards understanding patterns at the landscape scale is achieved by investigating mechanisms at a smaller scale. We developed the spatially explicit individual-based simulation model SATCHMO to test the null hypothesis that cyclical succession cannot emerge from a realistic patch scale simulation model of the population dynamics of savanna woody species. 3. We calculated the partial temporal autocorrelation coefficient for 100 simulated time series of shrub cover over 500 years for time lags of up to 200 years to establish the existence and duration of successional cycles. We found a significant positive autocorrelation indicating the existence of cycles with a typical duration of about 33 years. 4. The shrub size frequency distributions over the course of a cycle showed shifts from dominance of small shrub sizes towards larger sizes during the increasing phase of a cycle and the reverse in the declining phase. This supports the three phase explanation as follows: (i) an initial phase when spatially and temporally overlapping favourable conditions lead to mass recruitment of shrubs; (ii) a build-up phase when the shrub cohort grows; and (iii) a break-down phase when increased competition due to crowding and unfavourable conditions lead to the break-down of the shrub cohort. The frequency distribution of shrub age at death over 10 simulations was also in agreement with this explanation. 5. We investigated the relationship between shrub cover, annual precipitation and time-lagged shrub cover to identify the driver of the cyclical successions. More than 90\% of the variation in shrub cover was explained by shrub cover of the previous year, precipitation, and their interaction. 6. With the demonstration of precipitation-driven cyclical succession at the patch scale, we show that the mechanistic, temporal component of patch dynamics can be used to explain tree-grass coexistence in semi-arid savannas.},

@article{wigley_thicket_2010,
	Abstract = {Woody plant increase in grassy biomes has been widely reported over the last century. Increases have been attributed to local drivers associated with land use change, such as heavy grazing or fire suppression, or, controversially, to global drivers such as increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Here, we report a comparison of woody increase since the 1930s in three neighbouring areas with highly contrasting land use systems to help distinguish between local and global causes of woody increase. Aerial photography was used to measure changes in tree cover for three time intervals (1937, 1960, 2004) for three adjacent 25 km2 sites which remained under radically different tenure (conservation, commercial farms, and communal rangeland) over the study period. From previous studies on drivers affecting savanna dynamics, we predicted a decrease in tree cover for the conservation and communal sites and an increase in tree cover at the commercial site. The analyses showed highly significant increases in tree cover at all sites. Total tree cover increased from 14\% in 1937 to 58\% in 2004 at the conservation site, 3-50\% in the commercial ranching area and 6-25\% in the communal farming area. Reconstruction of past land use practices showed large differences in stocking rates, herbivore species, burning practices, human population densities and natural resource harvesting between the three sites. These land use differences are reflected in differences in woody cover among the three sites in 2004. However, despite major differences in land use, tree cover also increased significantly in all three areas. This suggests global drivers favouring woody plant increase in grassy vegetation regardless of land use practises. In our study area the most likely candidates are increased CO2 and/or atmospheric nitrogen deposition.},

@article{simon_recent_2009,
	Abstract = {The relative importance of local ecological and larger-scale historical processes in causing differences in species richness across the globe remains keenly debated. To gain insight into these questions, we investigated the assembly of plant diversity in the Cerrado in South America, the world's most species-rich tropical savanna. Time-calibrated phylogenies suggest that Cerrado lineages started to diversify less than 10 Mya, with most lineages diversifying at 4 Mya or less, coinciding with the rise to dominance of flammable C4 grasses and expansion of the savanna biome worldwide. These plant phylogenies show that Cerrado lineages are strongly associated with adaptations to fire and have sister groups in largely fire-free nearby wet forest, seasonally dry forest, subtropical grassland, or wetland vegetation. These findings imply that the Cerrado formed in situ via recent and frequent adaptive shifts to resist fire, rather than via dispersal of lineages already adapted to fire. The location of the Cerrado surrounded by a diverse array of species-rich biomes, and the apparently modest adaptive barrier posed by fire, are likely to have contributed to its striking species richness. These findings add to growing evidence that the origins and historical assembly of species-rich biomes have been idiosyncratic, driven in large part by unique features of regional-and continental-scale geohistory and that different historical processes can lead to similar levels of modern species richness.},

@article{haccou_establishment_2003,
	Abstract = {We consider establishment success (and extinction risk of small populations) in fluctuating environments, by means of an inhomogeneous branching process model. In this model it is assumed that individuals reproduce asexually during discrete reproduction periods. Within each period individuals reproduce independently and have random numbers of offspring. Expected numbers of offspring vary over reproduction periods due to random environmental changes. Previous simulation results indicated that there is a positive autocorrelation between the establishment probabilities of invaders in successive reproduction periods when environmental states are independently distributed. This result was never formally proved. In this paper we prove that this is indeed true, regardless of the form of the distribution of environmental states or the offspring distribution (under a monotonicity condition, which holds for biologically realistic models). Furthermore, we prove that it is also true for positively autocorrelated environmental states. We show by a counterexample that in environments with a strong negative autocorrelation establishment probabilities can be negatively autocorrelated. This was further examined through simulations. Our results imply that in independent, positively autocorrelated and weakly negatively autocorrelated environments the probability of success of invasion in different independently varying sites is the highest, followed by sequential invasion. For environments with a strong negative autocorrelation, sequential invasion has the highest probability of success. Effects of autocorrelation were further examined with simulations. From the results it appears that the expected length of 'runs of bad luck' is the most crucial factor for establishment success. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

This view anticipates only one optimal combination of trait values in a given environment, but it is also conceivable that alternative designs of equal fitness in the same environment might evolve. To investigate that possibility, we use a genetic algorithm to search for optimal combinations of 34 functional traits in a realistic model of tree seedling growth and survival. We show that separate lineages of seedlings evolving in identical environments result in many alternative functional designs of approximately equal fitness.},

Each site of the space may contain only one representative (also referred to as a particle) of either type. The spread mechanism for both species is the same: each particle produces offspring independently of other particles and can place them only at the neighboring sites that are either unoccupied, or occupied by particles of the opposite type. In the second case, the old particle is killed by the newborn. The rate of birth for each particle is equal to the number of neighboring sites available for expansion. The main problem we address concerns the possibility of the long-term coexistence of the two species. We have shown that if we start the process with finitely many representatives of each type, then, under the assumption that the limit set in the corresponding first passage percolation model is uniformly curved, there is positive probability of coexistence.

Yet, climate-induced tree mortality and biotic disturbance agents are largely absent from process-based ecosystem models. Using data sets from the western USA and associated studies, we present a framework for determining the relative contribution of drought stress, insect attack, and their interactions, which is critical for modeling mortality in future climates. We outline a simple approach that identifies the mechanisms associated with two guilds of insects -- bark beetles and defoliators -- which are responsible for substantial tree mortality. We then discuss cross-biome patterns of insect-driven tree mortality and draw upon available evidence contrasting the prevalence of insect outbreaks in temperate and tropical regions. We conclude with an overview of tools and promising avenues to address major challenges. Ultimately, a multitrophic approach that captures tree physiology, insect populations, and tree--insect interactions will better inform projections of forest ecosystem responses to climate change.},

@article{cox_canopy_1998,
	Abstract = {Land surface schemes are vital components of general circulation models (GCMs) which provide the fluxes of heat, water and momentum at the land--atmosphere interface. The fluxes simulated by these schemes are especially dependent on the way in which the canopy (or `bulk stomatal') conductance for plant transpiration is modelled. Considerable research has been carried out into the dependences of canopy conductance on the local environment, and empirical relationships for such dependences have been obtained by fitting the data collected in field and laboratory experiments. However, observed leaf level relationships between stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis suggest an alternative approach. Given an appropriate algorithm for scaling these values up to canopy level, such relationships allow canopy conductance values to be derived from (comparatively) well validated models of leaf photosynthesis. This approach is likely to become especially attractive as land surface schemes are extended to simulate CO2 fluxes, since the shared environmental dependences of canopy conductance and photosynthesis reduce the number of model parameters which require independent specification. This paper is concerned with the evaluation of canopy level relationships between photosynthesis and conductance using data from the first international satellite land surface climatology project (Islscp) field experiment (Fife). Simultaneous measurements of CO2 and water vapour fluxes, taken over a predominantly C4 grassland, are used to independently test the conductance and photosynthesis models. Based on these tests, a simple coupled model of canopy conductance and photosynthesis is developed, which produces a good match to the experimental data.},

	Abstract = {[1] We design a Bayesian inversion method (gradient-based) to optimize the key functioning parameters of a process-driven land surface model (ORganizing Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic EcosystEms (ORCHIDEE)) against the combination of prior information upon the parameters and eddy covariance fluxes. The model calculates energy, water, and CO2 fluxes and their interactions on a half-hourly basis, and we carry out the inversion using measurements of CO2, latent heat, and sensible heat fluxes as well as of net radiation over a pine forest in southern France. The inversion method makes it possible to assess the reduction of uncertainties and error correlations of the parameters. We designed an ensemble of inversions with different set ups using flux data over different time periods, in order to (1) identify well-constrained parameters and loosely constrained ones, (2) highlight some model structural deficiencies, and (3) quantify the overall information gained from assimilating each type of CO2 or energy fluxes. The sensitivity of the optimal parameter values to the initial carbon pool sizes and prior parameter values is discussed and an analysis of the posterior uncertainties is performed. Assimilating 3 weeks of half-hourly flux data during the summer improves the fit to diurnal variations, but merely improves the fit to seasonal variations. Assimilating a full year of flux data also improves the fit to the diurnal cycle more than to the seasonal cycle. This points out to the key importance of timescales when inverting parameters from high-frequency eddy-covariance data. We show that photosynthetic parameters such as carboxylation rates are well-constrained by the carbon and water fluxes data and get increased from their prior values, a correction that is corroborated by independent measurements at leaf scale. In contrast, the parameters controlling maintenance, microbial and growth respirations, and their temperature dependencies cannot be robustly determined. The CO2 flux data could not discriminate between the different respiration terms. At face value, all the parameters controlling the surface energy budget can be safely determined, leading to a good model-data fit on different timescales.},

	Abstract = {We utilized an ecosystem process model to investigate the influence of precipitation and soil water potential on vegetation phenology in the semi-arid, drought-deciduous ecosystems in the Kalahari region of South Africa. The timing of leaf flush was assumed to be the first day during which a rainfall event exceeded that day's estimate of potential evapotranspiration after a defined dry season. Leaf senescence was assumed to be a dynamic feedback between soil water potential and net plant carbon gain and was determined by dynamically modeling the effects of concomitant trends in soil water potential and net primary production on leaf area index (LAI). Model predictions of LAI were compared with satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) for 3 years at two sites along the Kalahari transect. The mean absolute error for the prediction of modeled leaf flush date compared with leaf flush dates estimated from NDVI were 10.0 days for the Maun site and 39.3 days for the Tshane site. Correlations between model predicted 10-day average LAI and 10-day composite NDVI for both Maun and Tshane were high (rho=0.67 and 0.74, respectively, P{\textless}0.001), suggesting that this method adequately predicts intra-annual leaf area dynamics in these dry tropical ecosystems.},

	Abstract = {P{\textgreater}We used a climate-vegetation-natural fire (CVNF) conceptual model to evaluate the sensitivity and vulnerability of forest, savanna, and the forest-savanna transition to environmental changes in tropical South America. Initially, under current environmental conditions, CVNF model results suggested that, in the absence of fires, tropical forests would extend c. 200 km into the presently observed savanna domain. Environmental changes were then imposed upon the model in temperature, precipitation and lightning strikes. These changes ranged from 2 to 6 degrees C warming, +10 to -20\% precipitation change and 0 to 15\% increase in lightning frequency, which, in aggregate form, represent expected future climatic changes in response to global warming and deforestation. The most critical vegetation changes are projected to take place over the easternmost portions of the basin, with a widening of the forest-savanna transition. The transition width would increase from 150 to c. 300 km, with tree cover losses ranging from 20 to 85\%. This means that c. 6\% of the areas currently covered by forests could potentially turn into grass-dominated savanna landscapes. The mechanism driving tree cover reduction consists of the combination of less favorable climate conditions for trees and more fire activity. In addition, this sensitivity analysis predicts that the current dry shrubland vegetation of northeast Brazil could potentially turn into a bare soil landscape.},

Understanding the relationship between human settlement patterns and elephant abundance is fundamental to predicting the viability of elephant populations. The prevailing model of human-elephant interaction predicts a negative linear relationship between rising human density and declining elephant density at a coarse (national or subcontinental) scale. Using observed elephant densities and human population data, we tested this prediction in a study area of 15,000 km(2) in northwestern Zimbabwe. The results did not fit a linens model Elephant and human coexistence occurs at various levels of human density, tip to a threshold of human density beyond which elephant populations disappear. This threshold seems to be related to a particular stage in the process of agriculturally transformed land becoming spatially dominant over the natural woodland that constitutes elephant habitat.

	Abstract = {Darwinian evolution favours genotypes with high replication rates, a process called 'survival of the fittest'. However, knowing the replication rate of each individual genotype may not suffice to predict the eventual survivor, even in an asexual population. According to quasi-species theory, selection favours the cloud of genotypes, interconnected by mutation, whose average replication rate is highest. Here we confirm this prediction using digital organisms that self-replicate, mutate and evolve. Forty pairs of populations were derived from 40 different ancestors in identical selective environments, except that one of each pair experienced a 4-fold higher mutation rate. In 12 cases, the dominant genotype that evolved at the lower mutation rate achieved a replication rate {\textgreater}1.5-fold faster than its counterpart. We allowed each of these disparate pairs to compete across a range of mutation rates. In each case, as mutation rate was increased, the outcome of competition switched to favour the genotype with the lower replication rate. These genotypes, although they occupied lower fitness peaks, were located in flatter regions of the fitness surface and were therefore more robust with respect to mutations.},

	Abstract = {The Venezuelan savannas, and in general Neotropical savannas, are composed of herbaceous co-dominant species and less abundant trees and shrubs, conditioned in great measure by the occurrence of annual fire events. We studied the growth dynamics of three grass species representative of the major phenological and architectural types: a precocious, bunch grass, Elyonurus adustus, an early, medium tall grass Leptocoryphium lanatum and a late, tall species Andropogon semiberbis. The experimental design included individuals of all these species growing alone, interacting in species pairs and all three species in competitive interaction. Close inspection of the data showed that the species differ widely in the spatial and temporal patterns of occupation of aboveground space, showing important levels of neighborhood interference among them. Shoot emergence during the time period between fire events (usually I year) is not a continuous process but occurs as a set of discrete cohorts. We model plant growth as a population of shoots governed by ordinary differential equations that accounts for the existence of different number of cohorts as a consequence of shoot competition. A comparison of simulated patterns to those observed in the field was assessed by the root mean square (RMS) error between the transient behaviors of both patterns. L. lanatum resulted both the most impaired and the least impairing of the three species and the opposite is valid for A. semiberbis. For the former species, the competition effect when growing together with the other two is stronger that when growing in pairs and close to an additive process. For E. adustus and A. semiberbis the addition of the third species does not substantially modified the effect obtained when competing in pairs. This model can be applied to the analysis of the herbaceous plant growth process on savannas subject to fire. With modifications, the model can be applied to other grass plants and other grassland ecosystems. We suggest that a possible mechanism involved in this process is the growth inhibition of the basal shoots by the older shoots of the same plant. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{cairns_root_1997,
	Abstract = {Because the world's forests play a major role in regulating nutrient and carbon cycles, there is much interest in estimating their biomass. Estimates of aboveground biomass based on well-established methods are relatively abundant; estimates of root biomass based on standard methods are much less common. The goal of this work was to determine if a reliable method to estimate root biomass density for forests could be developed based on existing data from the literature. The forestry literature containing root biomass measurements was reviewed and summarized and relationships between both root biomass density (Mg ha−1) and root:shoot ratios (R/S) as dependent variables and various edaphic and climatic independent variables, singly and in combination, were statistically tested. None of the tested independent variables of aboveground biomass density, latitude, temperature, precipitation, temperature:precipitation ratios, tree type, soil texture, and age had important explanatory value for R/S. However, linear regression analysis showed that aboveground biomass density, age, and latitudinal category were the most important predictors of root biomass density, and together explained 84\% of the variation. A comparison of root biomass density estimates based on our equations with those based on use of generalized R/S ratios for forests in the United States indicated that our method tended to produce estimates that were about 20\% higher.},

@article{kgope_growth_2010,
	Abstract = {Atmospheric CO2 has more than doubled since the last glacial maximum (LGM) and could double again within this century, largely due to anthropogenic activity. It has been suggested that low [CO2] contributed to reduced tree cover in savanna and grassland biomes at LGM, and that increasing [CO2] over the last century promoted increases in woody plants in these ecosystems over the past few decades. Despite the implications of this idea for understanding global carbon cycle dynamics and key global role of the savanna biome, there are still very few experimental studies quantifying the effects of CO2 on tree growth and demography in savannas and grasslands. In this paper we present photosynthetic, growth and carbon allocation responses of African savanna trees (Acacia karroo and Acacia nilotica) and a C-4 grass, Themeda triandra, exposed to a gradient of CO2 concentrations from 180 (typical of LGM) to 1000 mu mol mol-1 in open-top chambers in a glasshouse as a first empirical test of this idea. Photosynthesis, total stem length, total stem diameter, shoot dry weight and root dry weight of the acacias increased significantly across the CO2 gradient, saturating at higher CO2 concentrations. After clipping to simulate fire, plants showed an even greater response in total stem length, total stem diameter and shoot dry weight, signalling the importance of re-sprouting following disturbances such as fire or herbivory in savanna systems. Root starch (per unit root mass and total root starch per plant) increased steeply along the CO2 gradient, explaining the re-sprouting response. In contrast to the strong response of tree seedlings to the CO2 gradient, grass productivity showed little variation, even at low CO2 concentrations. These results suggest that CO2 has significant direct effects on tree recruitment in grassy ecosystems, influencing the ability of trees to recover from fire damage and herbivory. Fire and herbivore regimes that were effective in controlling tree increases in grassy ecosystems could thus be much less effective in a CO2-rich world, but field-based tests are needed to confirm this suggestion.},

	Abstract = {An increasing number of climate modelling studies use a general circulation model (GCM) coupled to a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM), yet the intrinsic properties of DGVMs and the feedbacks in this coupled system have not been fully investigated. Here we present details of several intrinsic properties of an established DGVM, TRIFFID, and its coupling with the Hadley Centre GCM. A new version of TRIFFID is first developed which is able to reproduce much of the behaviour of TRIFFID, yet is simple enough to be investigated analytically. This is used to show: (1) TRIFFID has a single stable equilibrium vegetation coverage, which depends on environmental conditions, (2) the dominant timescale of changes in vegetation structure is variable and is determined by environmental conditions through photosynthesis, and (3) TRIFFID damps out variability at periods less than the response timescale. From these results we conclude that the variability of the vegetation structure, and hence vegetation feedbacks can damp or amplify atmospheric variability through a shift in the response timescale, i.e. that vegetation feedbacks to the atmosphere are sensitive to the period of the atmospheric variability. 2006 Elsevier B.V.

@article{sorrensen-cothern_model_1993,
	Abstract = {The model of competition for light presented here uses modular autonomy to incorporate plasticity in plant growth under competition. Once plants are characterized as composed of modules, then model structure for competition changes in a fundamental way. Interactions between the plant module and its local resource environment must be modeled rather than the traditionally viewed interactions between whole plants and their neighbors. We assume that a plant module interacts with its local resource environment regardless of whether this environment was altered by a neighbor or by the same plant. Two spatial processes are considered: resource acquisition and growth. The spatial pattern of resource acquisition by a module determines a growth and allocation pattern, e.g., the elongation of branches into a gap. The spatial structure of a module and its connection to the whole tree then determines the pattern of resource distribution and resource acquisition of the next time step.Plasticity of plant growth is incorporated by variation in both the efficiency of resource capture of modules and patterns of resource allocation for individuals of different canopy positions and results in individuals in the community having different spatial structures. The model simulates the three-dimensional development of tree crown structure over time. It is applied to the 30-yr development of a dense, spatially aggregated stand of Abies amabilis beginning with an initial pattern of seedlings. The importance of incorporation of plasticity is apparent when the model output is compared to observed height distribution and crown structure data. Simulations indicate that asymmetrical crown development, one form of plasticity, is advantageous to stand productivity and becomes more advantageous as the degree of spatial aggregation in the initial spacing of trees increases.},

	Abstract = {The global distribution of C-3 and C-4 plants is required for accurately simulating exchanges of CO2, water, and energy between the land surface and atmosphere. It is also important to know the C-3/C-4 distribution for simulations of the carbon isotope composition of atmospheric CO2 owing to the distinct fractionations displayed by each photosynthetic type. Large areas of the land surface are spatial and temporal mosaics of both photosynthetic types. We developed an approach for capturing this heterogeneity by combining remote sensing products, physiological modeling, a spatial distribution of global crop fractions, and national harvest area data for major crop types. Our C-3/C-4 distribution predicts the global coverage of C4 vegetation to be 18.8 million km(2), while C-3 vegetation covers 87.4 million km(2). We incorporated our distribution into the SiB2 model and simulated carbon fluxes for each photosynthetic type. The gross primary production (GPP) of C4 plants is 35.3 Pg C yr(-1), or similar to23\% of total GPP, while that of C-3 plants is 114.7 Pg C yr(-1). The assimilation-weighted terrestrial discrimination against (CO2)-C-13 is 16.5parts per thousand. If the terrestrial component of the carbon sink is proportional to GPP, this implies a net uptake of 2.4 Pg C yr(-1) on land and 1.4 Pg C yr(-1) in the ocean using a C-13 budgeting approach and average carbon cycle parameter values for the 1990s. We also simulated the biomass of each photosynthetic type using the CASA model. The simulated biomass values of C-3 and C-4 vegetation are 389.3 and 18.6 Pg C, respectively.},

@article{pagani_late_1999,
	Abstract = {The global expansion of C-4 grasslands in the late Miocene has been attributed to a large-scale decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO,) concentrations. This triggering mechanism is controversial, in part because of a lack of direct evidence for change in the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) and because other factors are also important determinants in controlling plant-type distributions. Alkenone-based pCO(2) estimates for the Late Miocene indicate that pCO(2) increased from 14 to 9 million years ago and stabilized at preindustrial values by 9 million years ago. The estimates presented here provide no evidence for major changes in pCO(2) during the Late Miocene. Thus, C-4 plant expansion was Likely driven by additional factors, possibly a tectonically related episode of enhanced Low-latitude aridity or changes in seasonal precipitation patterns on a global scale (or both).},

@article{brovkin_biogeophysical_2006,
	Abstract = {Six Earth system models of intermediate complexity that are able to simulate interaction between atmosphere, ocean, and land surface, were forced with a scenario of land cover changes during the last millennium. In response to historical deforestation of about 18 million sq km, the models simulate a decrease in global mean annual temperature in the range of 0.13-0.25 degrees C. The rate of this cooling accelerated during the 19th century, reached a maximum in the first half of the 20th century, and declined at the end of the 20th century. This trend is explained by temporal and spatial dynamics of land cover changes, as the effect of deforestation on temperature is less pronounced for tropical than for temperate regions, and reforestation in the northern temperate areas during the second part of the 20th century partly offset the cooling trend. In most of the models, land cover changes lead to a decline in annual land evapotranspiration, while seasonal changes are rather equivocal because of spatial shifts in convergence zones. In the future, reforestation might be chosen as an option for the enhancement of terrestrial carbon sequestration. Our study indicates that biogeophysical mechanisms need to be accounted for in the assessment of land management options for climate change mitigation.},

@article{clemmensen_roots_2013,
	Abstract = {Boreal forest soils function as a terrestrial net sink in the global carbon cycle. The prevailing dogma has focused on aboveground plant litter as a principal source of soil organic matter. Using 14C bomb-carbon modeling, we show that 50 to 70\% of stored carbon in a chronosequence of boreal forested islands derives from roots and root-associated microorganisms. Fungal biomarkers indicate impaired degradation and preservation of fungal residues in late successional forests. Furthermore, 454 pyrosequencing of molecular barcodes, in conjunction with stable isotope analyses, highlights root-associated fungi as important regulators of ecosystem carbon dynamics. Our results suggest an alternative mechanism for the accumulation of organic matter in boreal forests during succession in the long-term absence of disturbance.
Forest Fungi
Boreal forest is one of the world's major biomes, dominating the subarctic northern latitudes of Europe, Asia, and America. The soils of boreal forest function as a net sink in the global carbon cycle and, hitherto, it has been thought that organic matter in this sink primarily accumulates in the form of plant remains. Clemmensen et al. (p. 1615; see the Perspective by Treseder and Holden) now show that most of the stored carbon in boreal forested islands in Sweden is in fact derived from mycorrhizal mycelium rather than from plant litter. Biochemical and sequencing studies show that carbon sequestration is regulated by functional and phylogenetic shifts in the mycorrhizal fungal community. The results will need to be explicitly considered in models of the role of the boreal forest in the global carbon cycle.},

This means that the maximum (peak) density of the populations of any trophic level can be easily forecasted provided the last two peaks of the same population are known. Moreover, extensive simulation shows that only the last peak is needed if the forecast concerns the population at the top of the food chain and that peaks variability often increases from bottom to top. All these findings bring naturally to the conclusion that top populations should be sampled in order to have higher chances to detect peak-to-peak dynamics.

Data for rates of xylem transport as a function of stem diameter show that rates of resource use in individual plants scale as approximately the 3/4 power of body mass, which is the same as metabolic rates of animals. Here we use this relationship to develop a mechanistic model for relationships between density and mass in resource-limited plants. It predicts that average plant size should scale as the -4/3 power of maximum population density, in agreement with empirical evidence and comparable relationships in animals,,, but significantly less than the -3/2 power predicted by geometric models. Our model implies that fundamental constraints on metabolic rate are reflected in the scaling of population density and other ecological and evolutionary phenomena, including the finding that resource allocation among species in ecosystems is independent of body size,,.},

However, the importance of rainfall relative to other drivers has never been formally examined.
* *Here, we conducted factorial simulations to ascertain the contributions of four environmental drivers (precipitation, temperature, humidity and CO2) to simulated changes in Amazonian vegetation carbon (Cveg), in three dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) forced with climate data based on HadCM3 for four SRES scenarios.
* *Increased temperature was found to be more important than precipitation reduction in causing losses of Amazonian Cveg in two DGVMs (Hyland and TRIFFID), and as important as precipitation reduction in a third DGVM (LPJ). Increases in plant respiration, direct declines in photosynthesis and increases in vapour pressure deficit (VPD) all contributed to reduce Cveg under high temperature, but the contribution of each mechanism varied greatly across models. Rising CO2 mitigated much of the climate-driven biomass losses in the models.
* *Additional work is required to constrain model behaviour with experimental data under conditions of high temperature and drought. Current models may be overly sensitive to long-term elevated temperatures as they do not account for physiological acclimation.},

	Abstract = {Delphinium barbeyi is a common herbaceous wildflower in montane meadows at 2,900 m near the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory, and its flowers are important nectar resources for bumblebees and hummingbirds. During the period 1977-1999 flowering was highly variable in both timing (date of first flower ranged from 5 July to 6 August, mean=17 July) and abundance (maximum open flowers per 2x2-m plot ranged from 11.3 to 197.9, mean=82). Time and abundance of flowering are highly correlated with the previous winter's snowpack, as measured by the amount of snow remaining on the ground on 15 May (range 0-185 cm, mean=67.1). We used structural equation modeling to investigate relationships among snowpack, first date of bare ground, first date of flowering, number of inflorescences produced, and peak number of flowers, all of which arc significantly correlated with each other. Snowpack depth on 15 May is a significant predictor of the first date of bare ground (R-2=0.872), which in turn is a significant predictor of the first date of flowering (R-2=0.858); snowpack depth is also significantly correlated with number of inflorescences produced (R-2=0.713). Both the number of inflorescences and mean date of first flowering are significant predictors of flowers produced (but with no residual effect of snowpack). Part of the effect of snowpack on flowering may be mediated through an increased probability of frost damage in years with lower snowpackthe frequency of early-season "frost events" explained a significant proportion of the variance in the number of flowers per stem. There is significant reduction of flower production in La Nina episodes. The variation in number of flowers we have observed is likely to affect the pollination, mating system, and demography of the species. Through its effect on snowpack, frost events, and their interaction, climate change may influence all of these variables.},

For this, we consider the standard Rosenzweig-MacArthur prey-predator model [The American Naturalist, 97 (1963), pp. 209-223] and, following the so-called adaptive dynamics approach, we derive from it a second-order evolutionary model composed of two ODEs, one for the prey trait and one for the predator trait. Then, we perform a detailed bifurcation analysis of the evolutionary model with respect to various environmental and demographic parameters. Surprisingly, the evolutionary dynamics turn out to be much richer than the population dynamics. Up to three evolutionary attractors can be present, and the bifurcation diagrams contain numerous global bifurcations and codimension-2 bifurcation points. Interesting biological properties can be extracted from these bifurcation diagrams. In particular, one can conclude that evolution of the traits can be cyclic and easily promote prey species diversity.},

In the model, growth on any given day is determined either by the amount of intercepted radiation (by means of the light utilization coefficient, epsilon) Or by the maximum rate of water extraction by roots (a function of root biomass and soil water content). In either case, transpiration and growth are related by the water-use efficiency (q), which is inversely proportional to the daily mean saturation vapor pressure deficit (D). The model was applied to two Pinus radiata (D. Don) stands (control (C) and fertilized (F)) growing near Canberra, Australia, using data collected during the Biology of Forest Growth experiment (1983-1988). For both stands, predicted and measured soil water contents were in close agreement (r(2) {\textgreater} 0.9) over a 4-year period involving several wet-dry cycles. The parameter combination epsilon/qD was estimated to be 0.28 and 0.26 kg H2O (MJ total)(-1) kPa(-1) for the C and F stands, respectively. Because of the close physiological link between water use and CO2 uptake, the results suggest that tree growth may be realistically simulated by simple models based on conservative values for epsilon and qD.},

@article{chesson_storage_2010,
	Abstract = {Frequency-dependent seed predation (FOP) has been shown to be a powerful coexistence mechanism in models of annual plant communities. However, FOP undermines the competition-based coexistence mechanism called the storage effect (SEc), which relies on temporal environmental fluctuations that drive fluctuations in competition. Although environmental fluctuations also drive fluctuations in predation, a storage effect due to predation (SEp) may not arise due to a time lag between a change in the environment and the resulting change in the predation rate. Here we show how SEp can arise with multispecies FDP, and in a two-species setting with density-dependent frequency-dependence, partially compensating for the reduction in SEc, in the presence of predation. These outcomes occur when predatory behavior is flexible, and can accommodate to changes in prey abundances on a within-year time scale, leading to changes in predator preferences in response to prey abundances in a given year. When predator preferences are determined by average prey abundances over several years, FDP is still a strong coexistence mechanism but undermines SEc without creating SEp. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

@article{westoby_evolutionary_2012,
	Abstract = {Sapwood cross-sectional area per unit leaf area (SA:LA) is an influential trait that plants coordinate with physical environment and with other traits. We develop theory for SA:LA and also for root surface area per leaf area (RA:LA) on the premise that plants maximizing the surplus of revenue over costs should have competitive advantage. SA:LA is predicted to increase in water-relations environments that reduce photosynthetic revenue, including low soil water potential, high water vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and low atmospheric CO(2). Because sapwood has costs, SA:LA adjustment does not completely offset difficult water relations. Where sapwood costs are large, as in tall plants, optimal SA:LA may actually decline with (say) high VPD. Large soil-to-root resistance caps the benefits that can be obtained from increasing SA:LA. Where a plant can adjust water-absorbing surface area of root per leaf area (RA:LA) as well as SA:LA, optimal RA:SA is not affected by VPD, CO(2) or plant height. If selection favours increased height more so than increased revenue-minus-cost, then height is predicted to rise substantially under improved water-relations environments such as high-CO(2) atmospheres. Evolutionary-attractor theory for SA:LA and RA:LA complements models that take whole-plant conductivity per leaf area as a parameter.},

Next, an estimate was made of the possible yield of perennial energy crops on the degraded areas as a function of the type and degree of degradation. Lightly degraded areas were not included, as these areas might be suitable for conventional food production. The total global potential energy production on degraded lands was assessed to be slightly above 150 and 190EJyr-1, for grassy and woody energy crops, respectively. Most of this potential, however, is on areas currently classified as forest, cropland or pastoral land, leaving a potential of around 25 and 32EJyr-1 on other land cover categories. Most of the potential energy crop production on degraded land is located in developing regions. China has a total potential of 30EJyr-1, of which 4EJyr-1 from areas classified as other land.

This simulator makes it possible to investigate impacts on the spatial distribution and the extinction probability of plant species. I present the results of a two-species competition scenario. Coexistence is found to be possible for competitively dissimilar species, and the criterion for this coexistence is given analytically in the reaction-diffusion approximation. A higher frequency of tree falls implies a smaller extinction probability of least adapted species. The multispecies model is also investigated. A mathematical quantity-the persistence function-permits measurement of the ability of a species to out compete other species locally. This quantity is compared with the average time to extinction, and it is computed for the TROLL simulator. I interpret the shape of this function in light of available information on the persistence function in simple interacting particle systems. These results indicate an analogy between the dynamics of forest communities and a simple discrete and spatially explicit model, the voter model. The ecological implications of this analogy are discussed and are extended to species-rich communities.},

	Abstract = {Most conservation practitioners rely on experience-based information for management decisions. In South Africa, government policy thus directs managers to base decisions for elephant management on the best available scientific information. The reliance of their management decisions on science, however, is unknown. We interviewed 30 managers from small to large protected areas in South Africa to evaluate whether science underpinned strategic and applied management decisions regarding elephants. We also evaluated their perspectives on limitations to, and opportunities for, greater reliance on science. Twenty-nine managers valued science as a platform for their decisions. However, most managers based decisions on experience-based information. Only 28\%, 30\% and 8\% of managers respectively developed objectives, identified issues and selected management methods on science-based information. Furthermore, only 30\% selected a desired number of elephants, and 5\% selected a population control method, according to science-based information. The probability of managers basing decisions on science-based information differed with management area size, tenure, planning timeframes and manager experience. However, except for experience, these relationships were weak, and overall an implementation gap between science and elephant management existed. Limitations for science to inform decisions included lack of relevance and application of science findings to respective management areas, and scientists' attitudes and credibility. Opportunities included more site specific studies, better communication of, and easier access to scientific material. These opportunities could enable scientists to contribute more effectively to elephant management decisions and improve the reliance on science among the wider community of conservation practitioners in Africa.

Here we extend allometric theory-how attributes of organisms change with variation in their size-and test its predictions against worldwide data sets for forest communities by quantifying the relationships among tree size-frequency distributions, standing biomass, species number and number of individuals per unit area. As predicted, except for the highest latitudes, the number of individuals scales as the -2 power of basal stem diameter or as the -3/4 power of above-ground biomass. Also as predicted, this scaling relationship varies little with species diversity, total standing biomass, latitude and geographic sampling area. A simulation model in which individuals allocate biomass to leaf, stem and reproduction, and compete for space and light obtains features identical to those of a community. In tandem with allometric theory, our results indicate that many macroecological features of communities may emerge from a few allometric principles operating at the level of the individual.},

We suggest that this distribution results from selection for the maintenance of outcrossing in historically large, outcrossing populations with substantial inbreeding depression, and from selection for selfing when increased inbreeding, due to pollinator failure or population bottlenecks, reduces the level of inbreeding depression. Few species or populations are fixed at complete selfing or complete outcrossing. A low level of selfing in primarily outcrossing species is unlikely to be selectively advantageous, but will not reduce inbreeding depression to the level where selfing is selectively favored, particularly if accompanied by reproductive compensation. Similarly, occasional outcrossing in primarily selfing species is unlikely to regularly provide sufficient heterosis to maintain selection for outcrossing through individual selection. Genetic, morphological and ecological constraints may limit the potential for outcrossing rates in selfers to be reduced below some minimum level.},

	Abstract = {We introduce the concept of dynamical phase coexistence to provide a simple solution for a long-standing problem in theoretical ecology, the so-called "savanna problem". The challenge is to understand why in savanna ecosystems trees and grasses coexist in a robust way with large spatiotemporal variability. We propose a simple model, a variant of the contact process (CP), which includes two key extra features: varying external (environmental/rainfall) conditions and tree age. The system fluctuates locally between a woodland and a grassland phase, corresponding to the active and absorbing phases of the underlying pure contact process. This leads to a highly variable stable phase characterized by patches of the woodland and grassland phases coexisting dynamically. We show that the mean time to tree extinction under this model increases as a power-law of system size and can be of the order of 10,000,000 years in even moderately sized savannas. Finally, we demonstrate that while local interactions among trees may influence tree spatial distribution and the order of the transition between woodland and grassland phases, they do not affect dynamical coexistence. We expect dynamical coexistence to be relevant in other contexts in physics, biology or the social sciences. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Deforestation for agricultural purposes started thousands of years ago and might have resulted in a detectable human influence on climate much earlier than the industrial revolution. This study presents a first attempt to estimate the impact of human land-use on the global carbon cycle over the last 6,000 years. A global gridded data set for the spread of permanent and non-permanent agriculture over this time period was developed and integrated within the Lund-Potsdam-Jena Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (LPJ-DGVM). The model was run with and without human land-use, and the difference in terrestrial carbon storage was calculated as an estimate of anthropogenic carbon release to the atmosphere. The modelled total carbon release during the industrial period (a.d. 1850--1990) was 148 gigatons of carbon (GtC), of which 33 GtC originated from non-permanent agriculture. For pre-industrial times (4000 b.c.--a.d. 1850), the net carbon release was 79 GtC from permanent agriculture with an additional 35 GtC from non-permanent agriculture. The modelled pre-industrial carbon release was considerably lower than would be required for a substantial influence on the climate system.},

	Abstract = {Changes in pCO(2) or ocean circulation are generally invoked to explain warm early Miocene climates and a rapid East Antarctic ice sheet (EAIS) expansion in the middle Miocene. This study reconstructs late Oligocene to late Miocene pCO(2) from epsilon(p) values based on carbon isotopic analyses of diunsaturated alkenones and planktonic foraminifera from Deep Sea Drilling Project sites 588 and 608 and Ocean Drilling Program site 730. Our results indicate that highest pCO(2) occurred during the latest Oligocene (similar to 350 ppmv) but decreased rapidly at similar to 25 Ma. The early and middle Miocene was characterized by low pCO(2) (260-190 ppmv), Lower intervals of pCO(2) correspond to inferred organic carbon burial events and glacial episodes with the lowest concentrations occurring during the middle Miocene, There is no evidence for either high pCO(2) during the late early Miocene climatic optimum or a sharp pCO(2) decrease associated with EAIS growth. Paradoxically, pCO(2) increased following EAIS growth and obtained preindustrial levels by similar to 10 Ma. Although we emphasize an oceanographic control on Miocene climate, low pCO(2) could have primed the climate system to respond sensitively to changes in heat and vapor transport.},

	Abstract = {Aim Woody plants were not widely considered to be important invasive alien species until fairly recently. Thousands of species of trees and shrubs have, however, been moved around the world. Many species have spread from planting sites, and some are now among the most widespread and damaging of invasive organisms. This article presents a global list of invasive alien trees and shrubs. It discusses taxonomic biases, geographical patterns, modes of dispersal, reasons for introductions and key issues regarding invasions of non-native woody plants around the world. Location Global. Methods An exhaustive survey was made of regional and national databases and the literature. Correspondence with botanists and ecologists and our own observations in many parts of the world expanded the list. Presence of invasive species was determined for each of 15 broad geographical regions. The main reasons for introduction and dissemination were determined for each species. Results The list comprises 622 species (357 trees, 265 shrubs in 29 plant orders, 78 families, 286 genera). Regions with the largest number of woody invasive alien species are: Australia (183); southern Africa (170); North America (163); Pacific Islands (147); and New Zealand (107). Species introduced for horticulture dominated the list (62\% of species: 196 trees and 187 shrubs). The next most important reasons for introduction and dissemination were forestry (13\%), food (10\%) and agroforestry (7\%). Three hundred and twenty-three species (52\%) are currently known to be invasive in only one region, and another 126 (20\%) occur in only two regions. Only 38 species (6\%) are very widespread (invasive in six or more regions). Over 40\% of invasive tree species and over 60\% of invasive shrub species are bird dispersed. Main conclusions Only between 0.5\% and 0.7\% of the world's tree and shrub species are currently invasive outside their natural range, but woody plant invasions are rapidly increasing in importance around the world. The objectively compiled list of invasive species presented here provides a snapshot of the current dimensions of the phenomenon and will be useful for screening new introductions for invasive potential.},

	Abstract = {Aim In the framework of the Global Land Cover 2000 (GLC 2000), a land-cover map of Africa has been produced at a spatial resolution of 1 km using data from four sensors on-board four different Earth observing satellites. Location The map documents the location and distribution of major vegetation types and non-vegetated land surface formations for the entire African continent plus Madagascar and the other surrounding islands. Methods The bulk of these data were acquired on a daily basis throughout the year 2000 by the VEGETATION sensor on-board the SPOT-4 satellite. The map of vegetation cover has been produced based upon the spectral response and the temporal profile of the vegetation cover. Digital image processing and geographical information systems techniques were employed, together with local knowledge, high resolution imagery and expert consultation, to compile a cartographic map product. Radar data and thermal sensors were also used for specific land-cover classes. Results A total of 27 land cover categories are documented, which has more thematic classes than previously published land cover maps of Africa contain. Systematic comparison with existing land cover data and 30-m resolution imagery from Landsat are presented, and the map is also compared with other pan-continental land cover maps. The map and digital data base are freely available for non-commercial uses from http://www.gvm.jrc.it/tem/africa/products.htm Main conclusions The map improves our state of knowledge of the land-cover of Africa and presents the most spatially detailed view yet published at this scale. This first version of the map should provide an important input for regional stratification and planning purposes for natural resources, biodiversity and climate studies.},

	Abstract = {Global terrestrial ecosystems absorbed carbon at a rate of 1-4 Pg yr(-1) during the 1980s and 1990s, offsetting 10-60 per cent of the fossil-fuel emissions(1,2). The regional patterns and causes of terrestrial carbon sources and sinks, however, remain uncertain(1-3). With increasing scientific and political interest in regional aspects of the global carbon cycle, there is a strong impetus to better understand the carbon balance of China(1-3). This is not only because China is the world's most populous country and the largest emitter of fossil-fuel CO2 into the atmosphere(4), but also because it has experienced regionally distinct land-use histories and climate trends(1), which together control the carbon budget of its ecosystems. Here we analyse the current terrestrial carbon balance of China and its driving mechanisms during the 1980s and 1990s using three different methods: biomass and soil carbon inventories extrapolated by satellite greenness measurements, ecosystem models and atmospheric inversions. The three methods produce similar estimates of a net carbon sink in the range of 0.19-0.26 Pg carbon (PgC) per year, which is smaller than that in the conterminous United States(5) but comparable to that in geographic Europe(6). We find that northeast China is a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere owing to overharvesting and degradation of forests. By contrast, southern China accounts for more than 65 per cent of the carbon sink, which can be attributed to regional climate change, large-scale plantation programmes active since the 1980s and shrub recovery. Shrub recovery is identified as the most uncertain factor contributing to the carbon sink. Our data and model results together indicate that China's terrestrial ecosystems absorbed 28-37 per cent of its cumulated fossil carbon emissions during the 1980s and 1990s.},

	Abstract = {The issue of scaling impinges on every aspect of landscape ecology and much of ecology in general. Consequently, the topic has invited a vast commentary. One result of scaling research is so-called scaling laws that describe how observations scale (e.g., as power laws). Importantly, such scaling rules seldom derive from a process-based understanding of why they emerge. Alternatively, the task of scaling is often addressed via simulation models. This is a scaling operation about which we are somewhat less confident, although recent advances in computing power and computational statistics provide for some promising new solutions. Here, I focus on methods for scaling simulations developed at fine grain and small extent, to their implications over much larger extent. The intent in scaling is to simplify the model while retaining those details essential for larger-scale applications. This approach should lead to scaling rules that are well founded in fine-scale ecological process and yet useful for making predictions at the larger scales of management and environmental policy.},

	Abstract = {Cavitation resistance is a critical determinant of drought tolerance in tropical tree species, but little is known of its association with life history strategies, particularly for seasonal dry forests, a system critically driven by variation in water availability. We analysed vulnerability curves for saplings of 13 tropical dry forest tree species differing in life history and leaf phenology. We examined how vulnerability to cavitation (P50) related to dry season leaf water potentials and stem and leaf traits. P50-values ranged from −0.8 to −6.2 MPa, with pioneers on average 38\% more vulnerable to cavitation than shade-tolerants. Vulnerability to cavitation was related to structural traits conferring tissue stress vulnerability, being negatively correlated with wood density, and surprisingly maximum vessel length. Vulnerability to cavitation was negatively related to the Huber-value and leaf dry matter content, and positively with leaf size. It was not related to SLA. We found a strong trade-off between cavitation resistance and hydraulic efficiency. Most species in the field were operating at leaf water potentials well above their P50, but pioneers and deciduous species had smaller hydraulic safety margins than shade-tolerants and evergreens. A trade-off between hydraulic safety and efficiency underlies ecological differentiation across these tropical dry forest tree species.},

	Abstract = {The decomposition of woody litter is a biochemical process, controlled by physical, chemical and biological environmental conditions. To develop a practicable model of this complex process, it is necessary to identify the major controlling factors and quantify their effects. We used four data sets (total N =2102) on mass loss of decomposing woody litter in Northern Europe to extend an earlier decomposition model of non-woody litter and make it suitable for describing also decomposition of woody litter. We compared alternative ways to model the effects of size and chemical composition of woody litter on decomposition using the Bayesian model selection theory. The best model fitted to the diverse data sets (woody litter of four tree species, diameter 0.5-60 cm, time series up to 70 years) with little systematic error. Based on this result, we concluded that the extended model is suitable for describing decomposition of woody litter of the common tree species in the boreal forests studied. According to the model developed, frequently observed sigmoidal patterns in mass loss of woody litter are related to high concentrations of slowly decomposing lignin compounds and these patterns become stronger with an increasing size of decomposing woody litter.

	Abstract = {Savannahs are a mixture of trees and grasses often occurring as alternate states to closed forests. Savannah fires are frequent where grass productivity is high in the wet season. Fires help maintain grassy vegetation where the climate is suitable for woodlands or forests. Saplings in savannahs are particularly vulnerable to topkill of above-ground biomass. Larger trees are more fire-resistant and suffer little damage when burnt. Recruitment to large mature tree size classes depends on sapling growth rates to fire-resistant sizes and the time between fires. Carbon dioxide (CO(2)) can influence the growth rate of juvenile plants, thereby affecting tree recruitment and the conversion of open savannahs to woodlands. Trees have increased in many savannahs throughout the world, whereas some humid savannahs are being invaded by forests. CO(2) has been implicated in this woody increase but attribution to global drivers has been controversial where changes in grazing and fire have also occurred. We report on diverse tests of the magnitude of CO(2) effects on both ancient and modern ecosystems with a particular focus on African savannahs. Large increases in trees of mesic savannahs in the region cannot easily be explained by land use change but are consistent with experimental and simulation studies of CO(2) effects. Changes in arid savannahs seem less obviously linked to CO(2) effects and may be driven more by overgrazing. Large-scale shifts in the tree-grass balance in the past and the future need to be better understood. They not only have major impacts on the ecology of grassy ecosystems but also on Earth-atmosphere linkages and the global carbon cycle in ways that are still being discovered.},

@article{wyka_responses_2012,
	Abstract = {Spectra of leaf traits in northern temperate forest canopies reflect major differences in leaf longevity between evergreen conifers and deciduous broadleaf angiosperms, as well as plastic modifications caused by within-crown shading. We investigated (1) whether long-lived conifer leaves exhibit similar intra-canopy plasticity as short-lived broadleaves, and (2) whether global interspecific relationships between photosynthesis, nitrogen, and leaf structure identified for sun leaves adequately describe leaves differentiated in response to light gradients. We studied structural and photosynthetic properties of intra-tree sun and shade foliage in adult trees of seven conifer and four broadleaf angiosperm species in a common garden in Poland. Shade leaves exhibited lower leaf mass-per-area (LMA) than sun leaves; however, the relative difference was smaller in conifers than in broadleaves. In broadleaves, LMA was correlated with lamina thickness and tissue density, while in conifers, it was correlated with thickness but not density. In broadleaves, but not in conifers, reduction of lamina thickness was correlated with a thinner palisade layer. The more conservative adjustment of conifer leaves could result from a combination of phylogenetic constraints, contrasting leaf anatomies and shoot geometries, but also from functional requirements of long-lived foliage. Mass-based nitrogen concentration (N(mass)) was similar between sun and shade leaves, and was lower in conifers than in deciduous broadleaved species. Given this, the smaller LMA in shade corresponded with a lower area-based N concentration (N(area)). In evergreen conifers, LMA and N(area) were less powerful predictors of area-based photosynthetic rate (A (max(area))) in comparison with deciduous broadleaved angiosperms. Multiple regression for sun and shade leaves showed that, in each group, A (max(mass)) was related to N(mass) but not to LMA, whereas LMA became a significant codeterminant of A (max(mass)) in analysis combining both groups. Thus, a fundamental mass-based relationship between photosynthesis, nitrogen, and leaf structure reported previously also exists in a dataset combining within-crown and across-functional type variation.},

Summary

Climate change exposes vegetation to unusual drought, causing declines in productivity and increased mortality. Drought responses are hard to anticipate because canopy transpiration and diffusive conductance (G) respond to drying soil and vapor pressure deficit (D) in complex ways. A growing database of hydraulic traits, combined with a parsimonious theory of tree water transport and its regulation, may improve predictions of at-risk vegetation. The theory uses the physics of flow through soil and xylem to quantify how canopy water supply declines with drought and ceases by hydraulic failure. This transpiration `supply function' is used to predict a water `loss function' by assuming that stomatal regulation exploits transport capacity while avoiding failure. Supply--loss theory incorporates root distribution, hydraulic redistribution, cavitation vulnerability, and cavitation reversal. The theory efficiently defines stomatal responses to D, drying soil, and hydraulic vulnerability. Driving the theory with climate predicts drought-induced loss of plant hydraulic conductance (k), canopy G, carbon assimilation, and productivity. Data lead to the `chronic stress hypothesis' wherein {\textgreater} 60\% loss of k increases mortality by multiple mechanisms. Supply--loss theory predicts the climatic conditions that push vegetation over this risk threshold. The theory's simplicity and predictive power encourage testing and application in large-scale modeling.},

	Abstract = {Top-down regulation of ecosystems by large herbivores is a topic of active debate between scientists and managers, and a prime example is the interaction between elephants Loxodonta africana and trees in African savannas. A common assumption among wildlife managers is that a local reduction in elephant numbers will ultimately allow woodland to self-restore to a desired former state. Such regeneration is, however, dependent on the survival of seedlings of impacted tree species. We conducted a field experiment to investigate seedling predation in the elephant-transformed Chobe riparian woodland of northern Botswana. We planted seedling gardens in (i) complete exclosures that excluded all herbivores except small rodents and invertebrates, (ii) semi-permeable exclosures that excluded ungulates but included primates, lagomorphs, all rodents, gallinaceous birds, etc, and (iii) completely open plots. Seedlings were of two tree species decreasing in the area (Faidherbia albida and Garcinia livingstonei) and two that are increasing (Combretum mossambicense and Croton megalobotrys). After 9 months, seedling survival ranged from {\textgreater} 75\% for all species in the complete exclosure to {\textless} 20\% for Faidherbia albida in the open plots. Survival of all seedlings except C. megalobotrys declined precipitously in open plots during the dry season when invertebrates are largely dormant but when impalas Aepyceros melampus (locally abundant ungulates) increase the browse components of their diets. Seedling survival in the open plots was negatively related to local impala density but unrelated to that of any other browser. Synthesis and applications. Our findings relate to the current debate about managing elephants to restore southern African savanna landscapes to desired historical states. Various seedling predators, including the ubiquitous impala Aepyceros melampus, regulate the regeneration of trees from seedlings, and our experiments support the hypothesis that tall closed-canopy woodlands originate during episodic windows of opportunity for seedling survival. To artificially recreate such a window would require the decimation of seedling predators as well as elephants, which is impractical at the landscape scale.},

	Abstract = {1. An emerging perspective in the study of density dependence is the importance of the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of resources. Although this is well understood in temperate ungulates, few studies have been conducted in tropical environments where both food and water are limiting resources. 2. We studied the regulation of one of the world's largest elephant populations in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. The study period started in 1986 when the population was released from culling. Using census data we investigated changes in elephant abundance with respect to rainfall and density across the entire park and across waterholes. 3. The population more than doubled since culling stopped. The population increased continuously during the first 6 years, and then fluctuated widely at about 30 000 individuals. Immigration processes must have been involved in the increase of the population size. 4. Population growth rates were negatively related to previous population density by a convex relationship, and negatively related to the ratio of previous population density on annual rainfall by a linear relationship. However, only this latter model (i.e. assuming a fluctuating carrying capacity related to annual rainfall) produced realistic dynamics. Overall, population decreased during dry years when the elephant density was high. 5. During dry years there were fewer waterholes retaining water during the dry season and consequently elephant numbers at waterholes increased, while their aggregation level across waterholes decreased. On the long-run elephant numbers increased only at the less crowded waterholes. 6. We suggest that the interaction between population size and the available foraging range determined by the number of active waterholes during the dry season controls the park population. 7. Our results emphasize the need to understand how key-resource areas cause resource-based aggregation, which ultimately influences the strength of density dependence. More specifically, this study suggests that climate variability strongly affects local elephant population dynamics through changes in surface-water availability. Finally, as dispersal is likely to be an important driver of the dynamics of this population, our results support views that a metapopulation framework should be endorsed for elephant management in open contexts.},

	Abstract = {Climatic effects on the decomposition rates of various litter types in different environments must be known to predict how climatic changes would affect key functions of terrestrial ecosystems, such as nutrient and carbon cycling and plant growth. We developed regression models of the climatic effects on the first-year mass loss of Scots pine needle litter in boreal and temperate forests across Europe (34 sites), and tested the applicability of these models for other litter types in different ecosystems from arctic tundra to tropical rainforest in Canada (average three year mass loss of 11 litter types at 18 sites), the USA and Central America (four litter types at 26 sites).
A temperature variable (annual mean temperature, effective temperature sum or its logarithm) combined with a summer drought indicator (precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration between May and September) explained the first-year mass loss of the Scots pine needle litter across Europe with a higher R2 value than actual evapotranspiration (0.68--0.74 vs. 0.51) and with less systematic error for any sub-region. The model with temperature sum and the summer drought indicator appeared best suited to the other litter types and environments. It predicted the climatic effects on the decomposition rates in North and Central America with least systematic error and highest R2 values (0.72--0.80). Compared with Europe, the decomposition rate was significantly less sensitive to annual mean temperature in Canada, and to changes in actual evapotranspiration in the USA and Central America.
A simple model distinguishing temperature and drought effects was able to explain the majority of climatic effects on the decomposition rates of the various litter types tested in the varying environments over the large geographical areas. Actual evapotranspiration summarizing the temperature and drought effects was not as general climatic predictor of the decomposition rate.},

	Abstract = {Abstract  We analysed 25 years (1980--2004) of demographic data on a small re-introduced population of endangered African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park (HiP), South Africa, to describe population and pack dynamics. As small populations of cooperative
breeders may be particularly prone to Allee effects, this extensive data set was used to test the prediction that, if Allee
effects occur, aspects of reproductive success, individual survival and population growth should increase with pack and population
size. The results suggest that behavioural aspects of wild dogs rather than ecological factors (i.e. competitors, prey and
rainfall) primarily have been limiting the HiP wild dog population, particularly a low probability of finding suitable mates
upon dispersal at low pack number (i.e. a mate-finding Allee effect). Wild dogs in HiP were not subject to component Allee
effects at the pack level, most likely due to low interspecific competition and high prey availability. This suggests that
aspects of the environment can mediate the strength of Allee effects. There was also no demographic Allee effect in the HiP
wild dog population, as the population growth rate was significantly negatively related to population size, despite no apparent
ecological resource limitation. Such negative density dependence at low numbers indicates that behavioural studies of the
causal mechanisms potentially generating Allee effects in small populations can provide a key to understanding their dynamics.
This study demonstrates how aspects of a species' social behaviour can influence the vulnerability of small populations to
extinction and illustrates the profound implications of sociality for endangered species' recovery.},

	Abstract = {Tree mortality is a critical attribute of forest ecosystems. But the factors responsible for tree mortality are ,poorly understood, particularly for trees in relatively healthy forests. I evaluated a conceptual model of the tree-mortality process that attributes tree death to a sequence of environmental stresses: long-term stresses that predispose trees to injury by short-term, inciting stresses. Tree-ring growth data from 63 dead overstory oaks (Quercus spp. L.) from seven Midwestern (USA) oak-hickory forests were employed as long-term records of tree vigor. Tree-ring growth data from surviving oaks from the same sites were utilized for comparison and as an indicator of year-to-year variations in environmental stress at each site. Utilizing time-series regression analysis, evidence of the action of inciting stresses was sought in the form of sudden and permanent declines, or interventions, in individual tree growth rates coincident with environmental stresses. Utilizing hierarchical regression analysis, evidence of the action of the predisposing stresses was sought in the form of reduced growth rates prior to the interventions. Three-fourths of the dead trees had growth patterns prior to mortality that included growth declines indicative of inciting stress. The median intervention resulted in a 38\% decline in basal-area growth rate. The interventions were more likely to occur during environmentally stressful years, with five drought years accounting for 40\% of the interventions experienced by the dead trees. Prior to experiencing interventions, the now-dead trees were growing an average of 18\% slower than comparable surviving trees, indicating the action of predisposing stresses. After interventions occurred, two decades typically passed before the trees died. The results indicate that, for oaks in the forests studied, tree mortality is usually a decades-long process involving a combination of environmental stresses. The observed mortality process provides a framework for identifying the causes of tree mortality but suggests limits on the utility of tree mortality as an indicator of forest response to specific environmental stresses.},

In contrast, there are a considerable number of general hypotheses that predict competitive ability as a function of a range of ecological traits, together with a suite of increasingly sophisticated models for competitive interactions between plant species. We re-analyse a data set on competition between all pairwise combinations of seven species and show that competition coefficients relate strongly to differences between the maximum sizes, root allocation, emergence time and seed size of species. Regressions suggest that the best predictor of competition coefficients is the difference in the maximum size of species and that correlations of the other traits with the competition coefficients occur through effects on the maximum size. We also explore the patterns of association between coefficients across the competition matrix. We find significant evidence for coefficient reciprocity (inverse relationships between the interspecific coefficients for species pairs) and transitivity (numerically predictable hierarchies of competition between species) across competition matrices. These results therefore suggest simple null models for plant community structure when there is competition for resources.},

	Abstract = {Ecological food webs define the feeding patterns of interacting species. The architecture of such networks may be affected by dynamical processes operating within them, ultimately influencing the capacity of the networks to persist. As yet relatively little is known about these effects. We compared the architecture of ecological networks with a fixed number of species, constructed in four contrasting ways: (I) topological networks, which required only that species had prey to eat; (II) persistent networks, in which species had also to persist under a simple model of population dynamics; (III) assembled networks, built up by sequential addition of species with dynamical persistence at each step in the sequence; (IV) evolved networks where, in addition to dynamical persistence, body size of species was determined by a simple mutation-selection process. Dynamics had fundamental effects on architecture, the networks of classes II, III and IV being restricted to a small number of trophic levels, in contrast to the non-dynamic, topological class I networks. Class III assembled networks tended to have fewer trophic levels and a more pyramidal biomass distribution than networks of classes II and IV. In evolved class IV networks, the smallest consumers converged to similar body sizes, whereas larger consumers evolved more slowly and did not show such convergence. The results indicate that dynamics affect the architecture of food webs, and that assumptions about simultaneous arrival, sequential arrival and evolution lead to different outcomes. Sequential assembly was shown to have a special property of finding rare sets of persistent species in a small number of steps, suggesting that the rarity of stable communities is not a serious problem in the development of complex communities.

	Abstract = {Recently, researchers in several areas of ecology and evolution have begun to change the way in which they analyze data and make biological inferences. Rather than the traditional null hypothesis testing approach, they have adopted an approach called model selection, in which several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with data. Model selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models. Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark-recapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now being implemented. By adopting this approach, researchers in ecology and evolution will find a valuable alternative to traditional null hypothesis testing, especially when more than one hypothesis is plausible.},

@article{liski_carbon_2005,
	Abstract = {Models are needed to estimate dynamics of carbon in forest soils, because changes in soil carbon are laborious to measure, and future levels of soil carbon can only be predicted using models.

Current process-oriented soil carbon models are not suitable to all forestry-related applications. This is because they require specific input information that is not available for all forests, and their time step is shorter than a year which is typically used in forestry.

We developed a dynamic soil carbon model Yasso to be used in forestry applications. Yasso simulates the stock of soil carbon, changes in this stock and the release of carbon from soil on an annual basis. It needs estimates of litter production, information on litter quality and basic data on climate to run.

Yasso consists of five decomposition compartments and two woody litter compartments. Its parameter values were determined based on measurements of litter decomposition and soil carbon.

The reliability of the output of Yasso was assessed by conducting an uncertainty analysis and comparing model-calculated estimates of soil carbon to measurements taken at different forest sites in southern Finland. According to the uncertainty analysis, the estimates for the amount of soil carbon are uncertain by nature, because they depend mostly on uncertain humus parameters. Still, when linked to a forest simulator to calculate litter production, Yasso gave similar estimates for the amount of soil carbon as were measured. The estimates for changes in soil carbon, on the other hand, are more reliable by nature because they depend on more accurately known parameters.

These and other tests conducted so far suggest that Yasso is applicable to forests in a wide range of environments. Further tests will increase confidence in using it for different soils.},

@article{macfarlane_modeling_2003,
	Abstract = {Advances in forest modeling make it possible to estimate light capture for every tree in a stand, and may allow for improvements in modeling stand dynamics. A major difficulty in using such models is that they rely heavily on parameterization of crown characteristics, which presumably differ from stand to stand. We reformulated crown parameters of the tRAYci light capture model for describing crown shape, relative foliar shell thickness and leaf area density (LAD) into generalized equations, which can be used to describe canopy dynamics in even-aged loblolly pine (P. taeda L.) stands. We used parameter equations to model 8 years of change in the canopy of 36, 17-year-old experimental loblolly pine stands, planted under a variety conditions, and estimated annual light capture for every tree over the study period. The results of our analysis suggest that differences in LAD between stands were effectively captured by our parameter estimation methods, but model predictions remained sensitive to parameters describing crown shape and foliar shell thickness. Our results suggest that estimated light capture from tRAYci is somewhat robust to different parameter settings because light capture estimation is strongly influenced by individual tree dimensions, and our methods enhanced this quality. General regression equations were developed for predicting crown characterization parameters from site index, stand age and stand density, but these equations did not fully capture differences in parameter values predicted from stand measurement data. Regression analysis and C-p analysis suggest that planting density was a superior predictor variable for characterizing canopy dynamics when compared to current density. Also discussed in this manuscript are general patterns in canopy dynamics with special references to tRAYci model structure and behavior. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

These experiments typically examined effects of elevated atmospheric CO(2), warming or drought (driver variables) on ecosystem processes such as the carbon and water cycle (response variables). Because experiments are inevitably constrained in the number of driver variables tested simultaneously, as well as in time and space, a key question is how results are scaled up to predict net ecosystem responses. In this review, we argue that there might be a general trend for the magnitude of the responses to decline with higher-order interactions, longer time periods and larger spatial scales.

An important consequence is metastability of vegetation state, with rapid vegetation switches occurring, some driven by anthropogenic CO2-stimulated release of trees from disturbance control. These have conflicting implications for biodiversity and carbon sequestration relevant for policymakers and land managers. Biodiversity and ecosystem change projections need to account for both disturbance control and direct climate control of vegetation structure and function.},

@article{keeley_fire_2005,
	Abstract = {C-4 photosynthesis had a mid-Tertiary origin that was tied to declining atmospheric CO2, but C-4-dominated grasslands did not appear until late Tertiary. According to the 'CO2-threshold' model, these C-4 grasslands owe their origin to a further late Miocene decline in CO2 that gave C-4 grasses a photosynthetic advantage. This model is most appropriate for explaining replacement of C-3 grasslands by C-4 grasslands, however, fossil evidence shows C-4 grasslands replaced woodlands. An additional weakness in the threshold model is that recent estimates do not support a late Miocene drop in pCO(2). We hypothesize that late Miocene climate changes created a fire climate capable of replacing woodlands with C-4 grasslands. Critical elements were seasonality that sustained high biomass production part of year, followed by a dry season that greatly reduced fuel moisture, coupled with a monsoon climate that generated abundant lightning-igniting fires. As woodlands became more open from burning, the high light conditions favoured C-4 grasses over C-3 grasses, and in a feedback process, the elevated productivity of C-4 grasses increased highly combustible fuel loads that further increased fire activity. This hypothesis is supported by paleosol data that indicate the late Miocene expansion of C-4 grasslands was the result of grassland expansion into more mesic environments and by charcoal sediment profiles that parallel the late Miocene expansion of C-4 grasslands. Many contemporary C-4 grasslands are fire dependent and are invaded by woodlands upon cessation of burning. Thus, we maintain that the factors driving the late Miocene expansion of C-4 were the same as those responsible for maintenance of C-4 grasslands today.},

@article{archetti_heterogeneity_2015,
	Abstract = {The extensive intratumor heterogeneity revealed by sequencing cancer genomes is an essential determinant of tumor progression, diagnosis, and treatment. What maintains heterogeneity remains an open question because competition within a tumor leads to a strong selection for the fittest subclone. Cancer cells also cooperate by sharing molecules with paracrine effects, such as growth factors, and heterogeneity can be maintained if subclones depend on each other for survival. Without strict interdependence between subclones, however, nonproducer cells can free-ride on the growth factors produced by neighboring producer cells, a collective action problem known in game theory as the ``tragedy of the commons,'' which has been observed in microbial cell populations. Here, we report that similar dynamics occur in cancer cell populations. Neuroendocrine pancreatic cancer (insulinoma) cells that do not produce insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) grow slowly in pure cultures but have a proliferation advantage in mixed cultures, where they can use the IGF-II provided by producer cells. We show that, as predicted by evolutionary game theory, producer cells do not go extinct because IGF-II acts as a nonlinear public good, creating negative frequency-dependent selection that leads to a stable coexistence of the two cell types. Intratumor cell heterogeneity can therefore be maintained even without strict interdependence between cell subclones. Reducing the amount of growth factors available within a tumor may lead to a reduction in growth followed by a new equilibrium, which may explain relapse in therapies that target growth factors.},

	Abstract = {A stochastic radiative transfer equation for the mean field and its solution for the case of discontinuous vegetation canopies is discussed in this article. The equation set satisfies the law of energy conservation and is amenable to numerical solution by the method of successive orders of scattering approximations. Special attention is given to analytical analysis of the effect of spatial discontinuity on the radiation field. Research indicates that a complete description of the radiation field in discontinuous media is possible, using not only average values of radiation over total space but averages over space occupied by absorbing elements is also required. A new formula for absorbtance, which extends the formula for a homogeneous case, was obtained for the general case of discontinuous media. The internal as well as the emergent radiation fields were validated using available radiative transfer models (one- and three-dimensional) and Monte Carlo model of computer-generated maize canopy. Additionally, the canopy reflectance simulation is assessed by comparisons with field data from shrublands. In all cases, the simulations compare well with both the Monte Carlo results and the field data. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.},

	Abstract = {When vulnerability curves are used to assess the susceptibility of plants to drought, the water potential corresponding to 50\% loss of conductivity is frequently used as a measure of susceptibility. However, this value does not distinguish between different patterns of conductivity loss, such as a rapid loss over a narrow water potential range versus a gradual decline in conductivity. We have applied an exponential sigmoidal equation to vulnerability curves obtained from four closely related Eucalyptus clones differing in drought tolerance. The coefficients of the equation were evaluated and statictically compared among the clones. If the air-seedling hypothesis of cavitation is accepted, these coefficients have biological relevance. One of the coefficients describes the position of the curve on the water potential axis and is equivalent to the water potential corresponding to 50\% loss of conductivity. This coefficient could reflect the size of the largest pit pore per xylem vessel. Another coefficient is related to the slope of the conductivity loss, and could reflect the range in maximum pit pore size per vessel.},

@article{van_de_koppel_patterns_1996,
	Abstract = {According to classical exploitation theory, an increase of primary productivity should result in increased herbivore grazing pressure, thus maintaining a low plant standing crop, However, field data obtained from a salt marsh revealed a maximal grazing pressure by hares, rabbits, and geese at intermediate levels of plant standing crop. Grazing pressure was relatively low in the more productive parts. We argue that this pattern is due to a low foraging efficiency of these herbivores in dense vegetation. In order to investigate this hypothesis, we examine a plant-herbivore model where grazing becomes less efficient in dense vegetation, and analyze the behavior of this model along a gradient of primary productivity. In systems of intermediate productivity, the model predicts that a plant-herbivore system may have two stable states. In one state, the herbivore maintains a low standing crop. The other state is dominated by a dense vegetation unsuitable for herbivore grazing. In systems of high productivity, the herbivore is unable to keep plant growth in check and a dense vegetation develops. Thus, in line with our field data but in contrast to classical exploitation theory, our model does not predict ''top-down'' control in productive environments.},

	Abstract = {There is interest in the global community on how fire regimes are changing as a function of changing demographics and climate. The ground-based data to monitor such trends in fire activity are inadequate at the global scale. Satellite observations provide a basis for such a monitoring system. In this study, a set of metrics were developed from 6 years of MODIS active fire data. The metrics were grouped into eight classes representing three axes of fire activity: density, season duration and interannual variability. These groups were compared with biophysical and human explanatory variables on a global scale. We found that more than 30\% of the land surface has a significant fire frequency. The most extensive fire class exhibited high fire density, low duration and high variability and was found in boreal and tropical wet and dry environments. A high association was found between population distribution and fire persistence. Low GDP km(-2) was associated with fire classes with high interannual variability and low seasonal duration. In areas with more economic resources, fires tend to be more regular and last longer. High fire duration and low interannual variability were associated with croplands, but often with low fire density. The study was constrained by the limited length of satellite data record but is a first step toward developing a comprehensive global assessment of fire regimes. However, more attention is needed by the global observing systems to provide the underpinning socio-economic observations to better quantify and analyze the human characteristics of fire regimes.},

	Abstract = {In frequently burnt savannas, saplings face the formidable challenge of both recovering from, and eventually growing tall enough to escape from, frequent fire damage. The aim of this study was to explore how saplings allocate carbon to achieve these ends through carbon partitioning, storage and remobilization. Lignotuber total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) concentrations and delta C-13 values of Acacia karroo (Fabaceae; Mimosoideae) were determined in plants from two different juvenile stages. These were one year after a fire when the plant consisted of numerous leafy shoots or coppices ("coppicing" stage), and three years after a fire when the plant consisted of one pole-like stem ("Gulliver" stage). Gulliver lignotubers were found to have significantly larger TNC pools (150 g vs. 97 g) and larger TNC concentrations (33\% vs. 24\%, w/w) than coppice lignotubers showing that post-coppice Gullivers recharged TNC in the lignotuber. delta C-13 values from the stems of plants in the Gulliver stage were significantly enriched ({\textgreater} 1aEuro degrees) in C-13 compared to both coppicing (P {\textless} 0.01) and adult (P {\textless} 0.05) plants. Changes in both the amount of stored carbon and in the delta C-13 values indicated dependence on stored carbon reserves, and partially heterotrophic growth for initial resprouting. The plants appeared to use both current photosynthate and stored carbon reserves for growth of the Gulliver stem. The use of stored carbon is hypothesized to promote fast stem growth rates to a height where saplings escape fire injury.},

	Abstract = {Large mammalian herbivores occupy half of the earth's land surface and are important both ecologically and economically(1), but their diversity is threatened by human activities(2). We investigated how the diversity of large herbivores changes across gradients of global precipitation and soil fertility. Here we show that more plant-available moisture reduces the nutrient content of plants but increases productivity, whereas more plant-available nutrients increase both of these factors. Because larger herbivore species tolerate lower plant nutrient content but require greater plant abundance, the highest potential herbivore diversity should occur in locations with intermediate moisture and high nutrients. These areas are dry enough to yield high quality plants and support smaller herbivores, but productive enough to support larger herbivores. These predictions fit with observed patterns of body size and diversity for large mammalian herbivores in North America, Africa and Australia, and yield a global map of regions with potentially high herbivore diversity. Thus, gradients of precipitation, temperature and soil fertility might explain the global distribution of large herbivore diversity and help to identify crucial areas for conservation and restoration.},

	Abstract = {This paper reviews observed (1900-2000) and possible future (2000-2100) continent-wide changes in temperature and rainfall for Africa. For the historic period we draw upon a new observed global climate data set which allows us to explore aspects of regional climate change related to diurnal temperature range and rainfall variability. The latter includes an investigation of regions where seasonal rainfall is sensitive to El Nino climate variability. This review of past climate change provides the context for our scenarios of future greenhouse gas-induced climate change in Africa. These scenarios draw upon the draft emissions scenarios prepared for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Third Assessment Report, a suite of recent global climate model experiments, and a simple climate model to link these 2 sets of analyses. We present a range of 4 climate futures for Africa, focusing on changes in both continental and regional seasonal-mean temperature and rainfall. Estimates of associated changes in global CO2 concentration and global-mean sea-level change are also supplied. These scenarios draw upon some of the most recent climate modelling work. We also identify some fundamental limitations to knowledge with regard to future African climate. These include the often poor representation of El Nino climate variability in global climate models, and the absence in these models of any representation of regional changes in land cover and dust and biomass aerosol loadings. These omitted processes may well have important consequences for future African climates, especially at regional scales. We conclude by discussing the value of the sort of climate change scenarios presented here and how best they should be used in national and regional vulnerability and adaptation assessments.},

	Abstract = {This work presents a new dynamic global vegetation model designed as an extension of an existing surface-vegetation-atmosphere transfer scheme which is included in a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model. The new dynamic global vegetation model simulates the principal processes of the continental biosphere influencing the global carbon cycle (photosynthesis, autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration of plants and in soils, fire, etc.) as well as latent, sensible, and kinetic energy exchanges at the surface of soils and plants. As a dynamic vegetation model, it explicitly represents competitive processes such as light competition, sapling establishment, etc. It can thus be used in simulations for the study of feedbacks between transient climate and vegetation cover changes, but it can also be used with a prescribed vegetation distribution. The whole seasonal phenological cycle is prognostically calculated without any prescribed dates or use of satellite data. The model is coupled to the IPSL-CM4 coupled atmosphere-ocean-vegetation model. Carbon and surface energy fluxes from the coupled hydrology-vegetation model compare well with observations at FluxNet sites. Simulated vegetation distribution and leaf density in a global simulation are evaluated against observations, and carbon stocks and fluxes are compared to available estimates, with satisfying results.},

To simulate the influence of fire on the dynamic equilibrium, as well as on potential change, of vegetation at the global scale, we have developed a fire model, running inside the modular framework of the Lund-Potsdam-Jena Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (LPJ-DGVM). 2 Estimated litter moisture is the main driver of day-to-day fire probability. The length of the fire season is used to estimate the fractional area of a grid cell which is burnt in a given year. This affected area is converted into an average fire return interval which can be compared to observations. 3 When driven by observed climate for the 20th century (at a 0.5 degrees longitude/latitude resolution), the model yielded fire return intervals in good agreement with observations for many regions (except parts of semiarid Africa and boreal Siberia). We suggest that further improvement for these regions must involve additional process descriptions such as permafrost and fuel/fire dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Simulation models that describe autonomous individual organisms (individual based models, IBM) or agents (agent-based models, ABM) have become a widely used tool, not only in ecology, but also in many other disciplines dealing with complex systems made up of autonomous entities. However, there is no standard protocol for describing such simulation models, which can make them difficult to understand and to duplicate. This paper presents a proposed standard protocol, ODD, for describing IBMs and ABMs, developed and tested by 28 modellers who cover a wide range of fields within ecology. This protocol consists of three blocks (Overview, Design concepts, and Details), which are subdivided into seven elements: Purpose, State variables and scales, Process overview and scheduling, Design concepts, Initialization, Input, and Submodels. We explain which aspects of a model should be described in each element, and we present an example to illustrate the protocol in use. In addition, 19 examples are available in an Online Appendix. We consider ODD as a first step for establishing a more detailed common format of the description of IBMs and ABMs. Once initiated, the protocol will hopefully evolve as it becomes used by a sufficiently large proportion of modellers.

Abstract
Increasing drought is one of the most critical challenges facing species and ecosystems worldwide, and improved theory and practices are needed for quantification of species tolerances. Leaf water potential at turgor loss, or wilting (πtlp), is classically recognised as a major physiological determinant of plant water stress response. However, the cellular basis of πtlp and its importance for predicting ecological drought tolerance have been controversial. A meta-analysis of 317 species from 72 studies showed that πtlp was strongly correlated with water availability within and across biomes, indicating power for anticipating drought responses. We derived new equations giving both πtlp and relative water content at turgor loss point (RWCtlp) as explicit functions of osmotic potential at full turgor (πo) and bulk modulus of elasticity (ε). Sensitivity analyses and meta-analyses showed that πo is the major driver of πtlp. In contrast, ε plays no direct role in driving drought tolerance within or across species, but sclerophylly and elastic adjustments act to maintain RWCtlp, preventing cell dehydration, and additionally protect against nutrient, mechanical and herbivory stresses independent of drought tolerance. These findings clarify biogeographic trends and the underlying basis of drought tolerance parameters with applications in comparative assessments of species and ecosystems worldwide.},

	Abstract = {Accurate assessment of the spatial extent of forest cover is a crucial requirement for quantifying the sources and sinks of carbon from the terrestrial biosphere. In the more immediate context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, implementation of the Kyoto Protocol calls for estimates of carbon stocks for a baseline year as well as for subsequent years. Data sources from country level statistics and other ground-based information are based on varying definitions of 'forest' and are consequently problematic for obtaining spatially and temporally consistent carbon stock estimates. By combining two datasets previously derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) at 1 km spatial resolution, we have generated a prototype global map depicting percentage tree cover and associated proportions of trees with different leaf longevity (evergreen and deciduous) and leaf type (broadleaf and needleleaf). The product is intended for use in terrestrial carbon cycle models, in conjunction with other spatial datasets such as climate and soil type, to obtain more consistent and reliable estimates of carbon stocks. The percentage tree cover dataset is available through the Global Land Cover Facility at the University of Maryland at http://glcf.umiacs.umd.edu.},

	Abstract = {The relationship between photosynthetic capacity (A max) and leaf nitrogen concentration (N) among all C3 species can be described roughly with one general equation, yet within that overall pattern species groups or individual species may have markedly different A max-N relationships. To determine whether one or several predictive, fundamental A max-N relationships exist for temperate trees we measured A max, specific leaf area (SLA) and N in 22 broad-leaved deciduous and 9 needle-leaved evergreen tree species in Wisconsin, United States. For broad-leaved deciduous trees, mass-based A max was highly correlated with leaf N (r 2=0.75, P{\textless}0.001). For evergreen conifers, mass-based A max was also correlated with leaf N (r 2=0.59, P{\textless}0.001) and the slope of the regression (rate of increase of A max per unit increase in N) was lower (P{\textless}0.001) by two-thirds than in the broad-leaved species (1.9 vs. 6.4 μmol CO2 g−1 N s−1), consistent with predictions based on tropical rain forest trees of short vs. long leaf life-span. On an area basis, there was a strong A max-N correlation among deciduous species (r 2=0.78, P{\textless}0.001) and no correlation (r 2=0.03, P{\textgreater}0.25) in the evergreen conifers. Compared to deciduous trees at a common leaf N (mass or area basis), evergreen trees had lower A max and SLA. For all data pooled, both leaf N and A max on a mass basis were correlated (r 2=0.6) with SLA; in contrast, area-based leaf N scaled tightly with SLA (r 2=0.81), but area-based A max did not (r 2=0.06) because of low A max per unit N in the evergreen conifers. Multiple regression analysis of all data pooled showed that both N (mass or area basis) and SLA were significantly (P{\textless}0.001) related to A max on mass (r 2=0.80) and area (r 2=0.55) bases, respectively. These results provide further evidence that A max-N relationships are fundamentally different for ecologically distinct species groups with differing suites of foliage characteristics: species with long leaf life-spans and low SLA, whether broad-leaved or needle-leaved, tend to have lower A max per unit leaf N and a lower slope and higher intercept of the A max-N relation than do species with shorter leaf life-span and higher SLA. A single global A max-N equation overestimates and underestimates A max for temperate trees at the upper and lower end of their leaf N range, respectively. Users of A max-N relationships in modeling photosynthesis in different ecosystems should appreciate the strengths and limitations of regression equations based on different species groupings.},

In recent years, several authors have presented models that explore how savanna fires suppress the woody community, alter ecosystem dynamics, and promote grass persistence. We argue, however, that the assumption that fires influence savanna dynamics by consuming woody biomass may be wrong because, in reality, fires kill seedlings and saplings that constitute little biomass relative to adult trees. We present a simple alternative that separates the woody community into a subadult (fire-sensitive) class and an adult (fire-resistant) class and explore how this ecologically more realistic, but still simplified, model may provide better simulations of demographic processes and response to fires in savannas.},

@article{quade_late_1995,
	Abstract = {Neogene sediments belonging to the Siwalik Group crop out in the Himalayan foothills along the length of southern Nepal. Carbon and oxygen isotopic analyses of Siwalik paleosols from four long Siwalik sections record major ecological changes over the past similar to 11 m.y. The carbon isotopic composition of both soil carbonate and organic matter shifts dramatically starting ca. 7.0 Ma, marking the displacement of largely C-3 vegetation, probably semi-deciduous forest, by C-4 grasslands. By the beginning of the Pliocene, all the food plains of major rivers in this region were dominated by monsoonal grasslands. The floral shift away from woody plants is also reflected by the decline and final disappearance of fossil leaves and the decrease in coal logs in the latest Miocene. A similar carbon isotopic shift has been documented in the paleosol and fossil tooth record of Pakistan, and in terrigenous organic matter from the Bengal Fan, showing that the floral shift was probably continentwide. The latest Miocene also witnessed an average change of similar to 4 parts per thousand in the oxygen isotopic composition of soil carbonate, as observed previously in Pakistan. The rea sons for this are unclear; if not diagenetic, a major environmental change is indicated, perhaps related to that driving the carbon isotopic shift. Recently described pollen and leaf fossils from the Surai Khola section show that evergreen forest was gradually displaced by semi-deciduous and dry deciduous forest between 11 and 6 Ma. The gradual nature of this floral shift, which culminated in the rapid expansion of C-4 grasses starting similar to 7.0 m.y. ago, is difficult to explain by a decrease in atmospheric pCO(2) alone (Cerling et al., 1993) but fits well with a gradual onset of monsoonal conditions in the late Miocene in the northern Indian subcontinent. Himalayan uplift, driving both monsoonal intensification and consumption of CO2 through weathering, may be the common cause behind major late Miocene environmental change globally. However, the decline of effective moisture associated with monsoon development has probably slowed, not increased, the rate of consumption of CO2 by chemical weathering of Himalayan sediments.},

@article{fan_hydraulic_2012,
	Abstract = {1. Stem xylem characteristics have a great impact on growth and adult stature of trees because of their role in mechanical support, long-distance water transport and whole-plant carbon allocation. Yet, despite the potential causal link between xylem traits and plant growth/adult stature, most studies have tried to link wood density, an indirect but easy to measure proxy for wood properties, to tree growth and size. 2. To determine whether xylem traits outperform wood density as predictors of tree growth and stature, we evaluated the covariation among wood density, xylem anatomical traits, tree diameter growth rate and adult stature in 40 Asian tropical tree species through principal component analyses and through bivariate correlation, both across species and across phylogenetically independent contrasts. 3. Vessel diameter exhibited a tight negative relationship with vessel frequency. Wood density showed a significant correlation with vessel diameter and density, but not with vessel fraction. Most correlations between functional traits indicate adaptive coordination, demonstrated by significant correlations between phylogenetically independent contrasts. 4. Across species, diameter growth rate and adult stature were positively correlated with vessel lumen diameter and potential hydraulic conductivity, but not with wood density. Thus, our results suggest that xylem anatomical traits that are linked to hydraulic conductivity are better predictors of tree growth rate and adult stature than wood density. 5. Synthesis. We found that xylem anatomical traits have a more significant influence on whole-plant performance due to their direct association with stem hydraulic conductivity, whereas wood density is decoupled from hydraulic function due to complex variations in xylem components.},

@article{shackleton_nearest-neighbour_2002,
	Abstract = {Inter- and intra-specific competition has long been regarded as a significant determinant of the structure and function of woody plant communities in African savannas. The most widely used approach to detect the presence or absence of competition has been the use of nearest-neighbour methods. Although several studies have been published reporting the presence of competition in Acacia dominated communities, less than 20 plots have been sampled across all these studies. Results from broad-leaved communities are variable, and also based on a small sample number. Consequently, this study sought to assess the prevalence of competition from a large number of savanna sites (45), and to identify abiotic and biotic factors characterising sites with competition relative to those without. Using the nearest-neighbour method only four sites (9.3\%) indicated the presence of inter-specific competition; two were Acacia dominated communities (18.2\% of Acacia sites) and two were broad-leaved communities (7.7\%). These four sites had a significantly higher mean annual rainfall and fewer woody species than sites without inter-specific competition. There were also significant relationships between the inter-specific competition index and the dominance index and the number of species at a site. In terms of intra-specific competition only ten of the 31 sites tested revealed a significant correlation between nearest-neighbour distance and summed canopy volume of the two neighbours. Seven were for Acacia species (55.6\% of the Acacia species comparisons) and three were for broad-leaved species (21.4\% of the broad-leaved species comparisons). Sites lacking evidence of intra-specific competition were at a significantly lower slope position and had a smaller proportion of small stems. The lower prevalence of competition in South African savannas detected in this study using the same method as previous studies is discussed, and the appropriateness of nearest-neighbour analysis is examined.},

Inclusion of such variation is important for continued progress in ecological and evolutionary theory. We provide a conceptual basis for IBMs by describing five major types of individual variation in IBMs: spatial, ontogenetic, phenotypic, cognitive, and genetic. IBMs are now used in almost all subfields of ecology and evolutionary biology. We map those subfields and look more closely at selected key papers on fish recruitment, forest dynamics, sympatric speciation, metapopulation dynamics, maintenance of diversity, and species conservation. Theorists are currently divided on whether IBMs represent only a practical tool for extending classical theory to more complex situations, or whether individual-based theory represents a radically new research program. We feel that the tension between these two poles of thinking can be a source of creativity in ecology and evolutionary theory.},

@article{huse_ecology_1998,
	Abstract = {A conceptual approach to study spatial movements of fish using an individual-based neural network genetic algorithm model is presented. Artificial neural networks, where the weights are adapted using a genetic algorithm, are applied to evolve individual movement behaviour in a spatially heterogeneous and seasonal environment. A 2D physical model (for the Barents Sea) creates monthly temperature fields, which again are used to calculate zooplankton production and predation pressure. Daily fish movement is controlled by reactive or predictive mechanisms. Reactive movement governs search for local optimal habitats, whereas predictive control enables adaptation to seasonal changes. Levels of growth and predation pressure at the time of decision are used to assess whether to apply reactive or predictive movement control. To make the model realistic on a large scale, each of the individuals are scaled up to represent a clone of one million siblings acting and growing synchronously. The fish lives for up to two years, and may reproduce in its second year. In order to spawn it has to be at the designated spawning area in the south-western part of the lattice in January. During spawning it produces a number of offspring in proportion to its body size. The ``genetic constitution'' of offspring (the weights of the synapses in the neural networks) is a mix of their ``mother's'' and a randomly picked member of the population. The model is able to solve the problem of navigating in a heterogeneous and seasonal environment. The movement of the artificial fish follows a seasonal pattern, typical for migrating pelagic fish stocks. During summer and autumn the distribution is widespread whereas during spring it is more concentrated. When trophic feedback is removed (i.e. zooplankton survival is independent of fish predation) the distribution of the fish is less dispersed which shows that the model allows for density dependent behaviour. Large-scale migration is an interplay between reactive and predictive movement control and when only one of these is allowed, the individuals are unable to adapt properly. Throughout most of its life the fish relies heavily on reactive movement, but during the spawning migration predictive movement control is applied almost exclusively.},

	Abstract = {Community ecology and ecosystem ecology provide two perspectives on complex ecological systems that have largely complementary strengths and weaknesses. Merging the two perspectives is necessary both to ensure continued scientific progress and to provide society with the scientific means to face growing environmental challenges. Recent research on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has contributed to this goal in several ways. By addressing a new question of high relevance for both science and society, by challenging existing paradigms, by tightly linking theory and experiments, by building scientific consensus beyond differences in opinion, by integrating fragmented disciplines and research fields, by connecting itself to other disciplines and management issues, it has helped transform ecology not only in content, but also in form. Creating a genuine evolutionary ecosystem ecology that links the evolution of species traits at the individual level, the dynamics of species interactions, and the overall functioning of ecosystems would give new impetus to this much-needed process of unification across ecological disciplines. Recent community evolution models are a promising step in that direction.},

@article{reich_leaf_1991,
	Abstract = {The relationships between resource availability, plant succession, and species' life history traits are often considered key to understanding variation among species and communities. Leaf lifespan is one trait important in this regard. We observed that leaf lifespan varies 30-fold among 23 species from natural and disturbed communities within a 1-km radius in the northern Amazon basin, near San Carlos de Rio Negro, Venezuela. Moreover, leaf lifespan was highly correlated with a number of important leaf structural and functional characterisues. Stomatal conductance to water vapor (g) and both mass and area-based net photosynthesis decreased with increasing leaf lifespan (r2=0.74, 0.91 and 0.75, respectively). Specific leaf area (SLA) also decreased with increasing leaf lifespan (r2=0.78), while leaf toughness increased (r2=0.62). Correlations between leaf lifespan and leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were moderate on a weight basis and not significant on an area basis. On an absolute basis, changes in SLA, net photosynthesis and leaf chemistry were large as leaf lifespan varied from 1.5 to 12 months, but such changes were small as leaf lifespan increased from 1 to 5 years. Mass-based net photosynthesis (A/mass) was highly correlated with SLA (r2=0.90) and mass-based leaf nitrogen (N/mass) (r2=0.85), but area-based net photosynthesis (A/area) was not well correlated with any index of leaf structure or chemistry including N/area. Overall, these results indicate that species allocate resources towards a high photosynthetic assimilation rate for a brief time, or provide resistant physical structure that results in a lower rate of carbon assimilation over a longer time, but not both.},

Methods for fitting a model to such data are briefly described. The method will fit the following parameters: V-cmax, J, TPU, R-d and g(m) [maximum carboxylation rate allowed by ribulose 1.5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), rate of photosynthetic electron transport (based on NADPH requirement), triose phosphate use, day respiration and mesophyll conductance, respectively]. The method requires at least five data pairs of net CO2 assimilation (A) and [CO2] in the intercellular airspaces of the leaf (Ci) and requires users to indicate the presumed limiting factor. The output is (1) calculated CO2 partial pressure at the sites of carboxylation, C-c, (2) values for the five parameters at the measurement temperature and (3) values adjusted to 25 degrees C to facilitate comparisons. Fitting this model is a way of exploring leaf level photosynthesis. However, interpreting leaf level photosynthesis in terms of underlying biochemistry and biophysics is subject to assumptions that hold to a greater or lesser degree, a major assumption being that all parts of the leaf are behaving in the same way at each instant.},

	Abstract = {1.The South and Middle American tropics contain the world's largest area of moist savanna. Despite an apparent uniformity in appearance, floristic groupings can be detected and four zones are provisionally outlined with a number of characteristic plants. 2. Although current knowledge of their biogeography and palaeoecology is scattered and incomplete, it is evident that there have been significant changes throughout the neotropics since the glacial maximum. 3. The largest and most significant savanna formations are the Brazilian cerrados, which occupy nearly 23\% of that country, an area equivalent to that of western Europe. The cerrados range from savanna woodlands (cerrados), through progressively less arboreal formations (cerrado), to nearly treeless grasslands (campo). A number of adjoining vegetation formations are closely related, including evergreen and deciduous forests, scrub woodlands and wetlands. 4. Until the last decade, the biological diversity of the neotropical savannas was thought to be limited since, structurally, they appeared to form a relatively simple mosaic of repeated physiognomic units. New evidence reveals a rich diversity of tree, shrub and herbaceous plants in a continuously changing spatial pattern. Such diversity reflects the great area of the biome, together with local differences in topography and drainage, soil conditions and fire frequency. 5. Research on the dynamic processes affecting savannas is of increasing importance and urgency given the potential value of the area that is still relatively undisturbed (about 50\% of the original, but with less than 2\% having federal reserve status) and the pace of current conversion to different forms of land use.},

	Abstract = {Growing empirical evidence suggests that aboveground and belowground multitrophic communities interact. However, investigations that comprehensively explore the impacts of above- and belowground third and higher trophic level organisms on plant and herbivore performance are thus far lacking. We tested the hypotheses that above- and belowground higher trophic level organisms as well as decomposers affect plant and herbivore performance and that these effects cross the soil-surface boundary. We used a well-validated simulation model that is individual-based for aboveground trophic levels such as shoot herbivores, parasitoids, and hyperparasitoids while considering belowground herbivores and their antagonists at the population level. We simulated greenhouse experiments by removing trophic levels and decomposers from the simulations in a factorial design. Decomposers and above- and belowground third trophic levels affected plant and herbivore mortality, root biomass, and to a lesser extent shoot biomass. We also tested the effect of gradual modifications of the interactions between different trophic level organisms with a sensitivity analysis. Shoot and root biomass were highly sensitive to the impact of the fourth trophic level. We found effects that cross the soil surface, such as aboveground herbivores and parasitoids affecting root biomass and belowground herbivores influencing aboveground herbivore mortality. We conclude that higher trophic level organisms and decomposers can strongly influence plant and herbivore performance. We propose that our modelling framework can be used in future applications to quantitatively explore the possible outcomes of complex above- and belowground multitrophic interactions under a range of environmental conditions and species compositions.},

@article{boulain_changing_2007,
	Abstract = {Net primary production (NPP) depends crucially on the sun radiation absorption, and hence its prediction on the modelling of the radiation. In heterogeneous systems such as savannas, the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) absorption is more difficult to predict than in homogeneous systems, due to the presence of tree clumps and open grass areas. Using a detailed 3D model, we propose new formulations of PAR absorption derived from the Beer-Lambert law for heterogeneous vegetation. To account for intra-plot vegetation heterogeneity we assume an intra-plot partition of space into two or three zones, based on tree location. We develop two models derived model from the Beer-Lambert law: (1) a simple partition of space below and outside trees, (2) a partition in three zones, including the tree shading area. The only model to predict PAR interception for all types of spatial patterns was the most complex one (including tree +tree shading zone +open grass areas). In this model, extinction coefficients can be derived from vegetation structural parameters like tree cover, and tree shading area. Tree shading area could be computed from geometric site parameters (latitude, longitude, tree height). With increasing satellite resolution it can be possible to obtain these structural parameters of vegetation (cover, overlap, tree height) needed by this Beer-Lambert derived model. Such an absorption model could then be used as a basis for a Monteith-style model of vegetation functioning for heterogeneous vegetation. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Ecological factors which cause selection for group territorial behavior are considered to be high adult survival and saturation of suitable habitat, modified by the demands of different feeding strategies. Cooperative breeding is viewed as a consequence of group territorial behavior, and a nonmathematical model is presented which predicts that maximum positive assistance by nonbreeders to the reproductive success of the breeding pair should occur in situations where it would not otherwise increase the fitness of the breeders to allow nonbreeders to remain within their territory. A decrease in the per capita reproductive rate of group territorial species, compared with similar pair-territorial species, is regarded as a by-product of the social system, not a specific adaptation.},

	Abstract = {Species distributions are already affected by climate change. Forecasting their long-term evolution requires models with thoroughly assessed validation. Our aim here is to demonstrate that the sensitivity of such models to climate input characteristics may complicate their validation and introduce uncertainties in their predictions. In this study, we conducted a sensitivity analysis of a process-based tree distribution model PHENOFIT to climate input characteristics. This analysis was conducted for two North American trees which differ greatly in their distribution and eight different types of climate input for the historic period which differ in their spatial (local or gridded data) and temporal (daily vs. monthly) resolution as well as their type (locally recorded, extrapolated or simulated by General Circulation Models). We show that the climate data resolution (spatial and temporal) and their type, highly affect the model predictions. The sensitivity analysis also revealed, the importance, for global climate change impact assessment, of (i) the daily variability of temperatures in modeling the biological processes shaping species distribution, (ii) climate data at high latitudes and elevations and (iii) climate data with high spatial resolution.},

@article{cavaleri_foliar_2008,
	Abstract = {Foliar respiration is a major component of ecosystem respiration, yet extrapolations are often uncertain in tropical forests because of indirect estimates of leaf area index (LAI). A portable tower was used to directly measure LAI and night-time foliar respiration from 52 vertical transects throughout an old-growth tropical rain forest in Costa Rica. In this study, we (1) explored the effects of structural, functional and environmental variables on foliar respiration; (2) extrapolated foliar respiration to the ecosystem; and (3) estimated ecosystem respiration. Foliar respiration temperature response was constant within plant functional group, and foliar morphology drove much of the within-canopy variability in respiration and foliar nutrients. Foliar respiration per unit ground area was 3.5 +/- 0.2 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), and ecosystem respiration was 9.4 +/- 0.5 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) [soil = 41\%; foliage = 37\%; woody = 14\%; coarse woody debris (CWD) = 7\%]. When modelled with El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) year temperatures, foliar respiration was 9\% greater than when modelled with temperatures from a normal year, which is in the range of carbon sink versus source behaviour for this forest. Our ecosystem respiration estimate from component fluxes was 33\% greater than night-time net ecosystem exchange for the same forest, suggesting that studies reporting a large carbon sink for tropical rain forests based solely on eddy flux measurements may be in error.},

@article{kurschner_oak_1996,
	Abstract = {Complementary to the interpretation of delta(13)C values of biogenic carbonate and sedimentary organic carbon in marine sediments, paleoatmospheric CO2 levels can be estimated by considering the inverse relationship between atmospheric CO2, concentration and stomatal parameters (frequency, size) on leaves of land plants. In woody plants, the significance of this (species-specific) physiological response to changing CO2 regimes is now repeatedly confirmed, both experimentally and from historical sequences of leaves collected since the onset of industrialization. A corollary of this relationship is that analysis of stomatal parameters on fossil leaves has the potential of determining changes in paleoatmospheric CO2 levels at different time scales, Well-preserved cuticle remains of oak leaves from late Miocene, Pliocene and early Pleistocene sediments of the Lower Rhine Embayment (Germany, The Netherlands) give promise of extending the record of stomatal frequency response to the last 10 Ma. During intervals with warm-temperate,to subtropical climatic conditions, oak leaves are characterized by a high stomatal resistance (or low conductance) to CO2 diffusion and low stomatal frequencies; during cooler intervals we observe an opposite picture. Comparison with historical relations between CO2 concentration and stomatal properties suggests that paleoatmospheric CO2 concentrations were not significantly higher than during the last 200 years and fluctuated several times between 280 and 370 ppmv in covariation with contrasting regional climatic conditions. On a global scale, intervals with reduced CO2 levels match glacial pulses characterized by the occurrence of ice-rafted detritus in high-latitude oceanic sediments.},

	Abstract = {Global warming is predicted to induce desiccation in many world regions through increases in evaporative demand(1-3). Rising CO2 may counter that trend by improving plant water-use efficiency(4,5). However, it is not clear how important this CO2-enhanced water use efficiency might be in offsetting warming-induced desiccation because higher CO2 also leads to higher plant biomass, and therefore greater transpirational surface(2,6,7). Furthermore, although warming is predicted to favour warm-season, C-4 grasses, rising CO2 should favour C-3, or cool-season plants(8). Here we show in a semi-arid grassland that elevated CO2 can completely reverse the desiccating effects of moderate warming. Although enrichment of air to 600 p. p. m. v. CO2 increased soil water content (SWC), 1.5/3.0 degrees C day/night warming resulted in desiccation, such that combined CO2 enrichment and warming had no effect on SWC relative to control plots. As predicted, elevated CO2 favoured C-3 grasses and enhanced stand productivity, whereas warming favoured C-4 grasses. Combined warming and CO2 enrichment stimulated above-ground growth of C-4 grasses in 2 of 3 years when soil moisture most limited plant productivity. The results indicate that in a warmer, CO2-enriched world, both SWC and productivity in semi-arid grasslands may be higher than previously expected.},

The rainfall atlas, which is accessible online at the URI http://134.76.173.220/ rainfall/index.hunl, was constructed in a number of phases over some 20 years. In the first phase, a 16 parameter model was developed, validated for representative sites, and then fitted to daily rainfall data from 2550 sites. Eight years later the estimates of the model parameters were updated, extended to 5070 sites, and interpolated on a grid of 1 minute of a degree of latitude and longitude over the entire region of southern Africa, namely South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland. The method of kriging with external drift was used for the interpolation. The interpolated estimates were used to generate long artificial daily rainfall sequences at a spatial resolution of 1 minute of degree square. The sequences were used to compute rainfall-related statistics, such as percentiles of annual and monthly rainfall distributions, probabilities associated with droughts, and additional measures relating to the timing and intensity of rainfall. The final phase, information transfer, was the construction of the Atlas website, which offers online access to a wide range of rainfall-related statistics and some 5000 maps. To facilitate the computation of statistics that are not available in the database, the Atlas enables users to generate, and then import, artificial sequences online, for any grid point in southern Africa. These sequences are designed to mirror the properties of real rainfall records (seasonality, serial dependence, distributional properties, etc.) at the required grid point and can be used to compute quantities of interest empirically.

By formulating and analysing a simple, general model incorporating these features, we identify ecological conditions and life-history features that lead to stable coexistence or competitive exclusion (with or without initial-condition dependence) and gain insight by linking these to case studies in the literature. We demonstrate the importance of contact inhibition, a little-studied feature of overgrowth, and we show how life-history tradeoffs may influence and be influenced by local competition for space. The general model we present can help indicate whether local interactions are sufficient to explain patterns of coexistence or exclusion and can serve as the foundation for more specific, realistic models of spatial competition.},

Palaeotemperature trends from the two places are presented by means of Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of pollen data, allowing a new regional palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. Correlation in the older sections of the sequences, beyond radiocarbon dating, is tentative, suggesting that the Wonderkrater sequence is roughly 4 times younger than the Tswaing sequence. Combined, temperature indications from the two sites suggest cooling at ca. 14,000 yr BP and slight warming at ca. 15,000 yr BP. Although no data are available between ca. 15,000 and 21,000, and 25,000 and 31,000 yr BP, generally cool conditions are suggested between ca. 11,000 and 33,000 yr BP. Between ca. 33,000 and an extrapolated age of ca. 80,000 yr BP, at least three warmer pulses of varying intensity occurred. No data are available between ca. 80,000 and 150,000 yr, but between 150,000 and ca. 190,000 yr BP, two cool and two moderately warm phases are suggested.

	Abstract = {Terrestrial ecosystems are highly responsive to their local environments and, as such, the rate of carbon uptake both in shorter and longer timescales and different spatial scales depends on local environmental drivers. For savannas, the key environmental drivers controlling vegetation productivity are water and nutrient availability, vapour pressure deficit (VPD), solar radiation and fire. Changes in these environmental factors can modify the carbon balance of these ecosystems. Therefore, understanding the environmental drivers responsible for the patterns (temporal and spatial) and processes (photosynthesis and respiration) has become a central goal in terrestrial carbon cycle studies. Here we have reviewed the various environmental controls on the spatial and temporal patterns on savanna carbon fluxes in northern Australia. Such studies are critical in predicting the impacts of future climate change on savanna productivity and carbon storage.},

@article{zimmermann_recruitment_2008,
	Abstract = {1Demographic processes, particularly the recruitment of seedlings, are critical to the long-term survival and re-establishment of plant populations. In many perennial grasslands successful recruitment is a rare event that requires the simultaneous favourable alignment of several environmental variables.2Although a few empirical studies have examined demographic processes in perennial grasslands, most of these studies investigate the impact of only one or two environmental factors in isolation. Those studies would lead us to expect that seed availability, irrigation and burning, enhance recruitment rates whereas the presence of established competitors substantially lowers recruitment rates. But how these factors, or recruitment filters, act in concert and how they influence the different components of the recruitment process such as seedling emergence, survival and growth is not understood.3For this reason we explore the relative and combined influence of four factors -- seed availability, irrigation, competition by the established vegetation, and fire -- on the recruitment process of a perennial grass (Stipagrostis uniplumis) in semi-arid savanna. We used a full factorial experiment to determine how these four factors influence emergence, growth, survival and flowering of seedlings.4Our results show that all of the factors affected some stage of the recruitment process but not all significant effects contributed to enhancing the final number of recruits.5We found enhanced seed availability to significantly enhance rates of seedling emergence but to play no further role in the recruitment process. Competition by the established vegetation exerted a strong negative effect on every step of the recruitment process. Irrigation had a minor effect on recruitment. It enhanced rates of flowering and survival during the growing season but the effect of the stimulus was short-lived and did not influence later stages of the recruitment process.6In contradiction to existing theory, seedling recruitment does therefore not seem to be limited to above average rainfall years. Fire acted similarly to the removal of competitors; that is, it positively affected seedling emergence, growth, flowering and survival.7Synthesis. We conclude that recruitment is not limited to above average rainfall years but triggered by events that open up the grass canopy and reduce the abundance of competitors. Specifically it appears that periodic fires enable the recruitment of new individuals into the population. This study shows that fire can play an important positive role in individual turnover of semi-arid perennial grass populations.},

@article{smeets_bioenergy_2007,
	Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate the global energy production potential of woody biomass from forestry for the year 2050 using a bottom-up analysis of key factors. Woody biomass from forestry was defined as all of the aboveground woody biomass of trees, including all products made from woody biomass. This includes the harvesting, processing and use of woody biomass. The projection was performed by comparing the future demand with the future supply of wood, based on existing databases, scenarios, and outlook studies. Specific attention was paid to the impact of the underlying factors that determine this potential and to the gaps and uncertainties in our current knowledge. Key variables included the demand for industrial roundwood and woodfuel, the plantation establishment rates, and the various theoretical, technical, economical, and ecological limitations related to the supply of wood from forests. Forests, as defined in this study, exclude forest plantations. Key uncertainties were the supply of wood from trees outside forests, the future rates of deforestation, the consumption of woodfuel, and the theoretical, technical, economical, or ecological wood production potentials of the forests. Based on a medium demand and medium plantation scenario, the global theoretical potential of the surplus wood supply (i.e., after the demand for woodfuel and industrial roundwood is met) in 2050 was calculated to be 6.1 Gm(3) (71 EJ) and the technical potential to be 5.5 Gm(3) (64 EJ). In practice, economical considerations further reduced the surplus wood supply from forests to 1.3 Gm(3) year(-1) (15 EJ year(-1)). When ecological criteria were also included, the demand for woodfuel and industrial roundwood exceeded the supply by 0.7 Gm(3) year(-1) (8 EJ year(-1)). The bioenergy potential from logging and processing residues and waste was estimated to be equivalent to 2.4 Gm(3) year(-1) (28 EJ year(-1)) wood, based on a medium demand scenario. These results indicate that forests can, in theory, become a major source of bioenergy, and that the use of this bioenergy can, in theory, be realized without endangering the supply of industrial roundwood and woodfuel and without further deforestation. Regional shortages in the supply of industrial roundwood and woodfuel can, however, occur in some regions, e.g., South Asia and the Middle East and North Africa.},

Emerson and Kolm show that the proportion of species endemic to an island is positively related to its species richness and, assuming that endemism indexes speciation rate, they infer that greater species diversity accelerates diversification. Here we demonstrate that the same correlation between species richness and percentage endemism can arise even if within-island speciation is negligible, particularly when both endemism and species richness depend on attributes of islands (such as area) that influence the average age of resident populations. Island biogeography theory indicates that, where the average time to extinction is relatively long, diversity increases through colonization, irrespective of whether new species are formed; at the same time, islands on which populations persist for longer accumulate more endemic species as local populations differentiate and populations on neighbouring islands become extinct. We therefore suggest that species richness and endemism are correlated fortuitously owing to their mutual dependence on the life spans of populations on islands, which is unrelated to speciation itself.},

@article{schymanski_optimality-based_2008,
	Abstract = {The main processes determining soil moisture dynamics are infiltration, percolation, evaporation and root water uptake. Modelling soil moisture dynamics therefore requires an interdisciplinary approach that links hydrological, atmospheric and biological processes. Previous approaches treat either root water uptake rates or root distributions and transpiration rates as given, and calculate the soil moisture dynamics based on the theory of flow in unsaturated media. The present study introduces a different approach to linking soil water and vegetation dynamics, based on vegetation optimality. Assuming that plants have evolved mechanisms that minimise costs related to the maintenance of the root system while meeting their demand for water, we develop a model that dynamically adjusts the vertical root distribution in the soil profile to meet this objective. The model was used to compute the soil moisture dynamics, root water uptake and fine root respiration in a tropical savanna over 12 months, and the results were compared with observations at the site and with a model based on a fixed root distribution. The optimality-based model reproduced the main features of the observations such as a shift of roots from the shallow soil in the wet season to the deeper soil in the dry season and substantial root water uptake during the dry season. At the same time, simulated fine root respiration rates never exceeded the upper envelope determined by the observed soil respiration. The model based on a fixed root distribution, in contrast, failed to explain the magnitude of water use during parts of the dry season and largely over-estimated root respiration rates. The observed surface soil moisture dynamics were also better reproduced by the optimality-based model than the model based on a prescribed root distribution. The optimality-based approach has the potential to reduce the number of unknowns in a model (e.g. the vertical root distribution), which makes it a valuable alternative to more empirically-based approaches, especially for simulating possible responses to environmental change.},

Here, we quantified foliar carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content, C : N ratio, phenolic levels, specific leaf area (SLA) and the amount of leaf tissue damaged by chewing insects for 12 hardwood tree species grown in plots exposed to elevated CO2 (ambient plus 200 \&mu; l l(-1)) using free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) over 3 yr. The effects of elevated CO2 varied considerably by year and across species. Elevated CO2 decreased herbivore damage across 12 species in 1 yr but had no detectable effect in others. Decreased damage may have been related to lower average foliar N concentration and SLA and increased C : N ratio and phenolic content for some species under elevated compared with ambient CO2. It remains unclear how these changes in leaf properties affect herbivory. Damage to the leaves of hardwood trees by herbivorous insects may be reduced in the future as the concentration of CO2 continues to increase, perhaps altering the trophic structure of forest ecosystems.},

Particularly, in the context of global change, simulations of the consequences of drought on crop plants are needed to design more efficient and water-saving cropping systems. However, most of the models of stomatal conductance (g(s)) developed at the leaf level link g(s) to environmental factors or net photosynthesis (A(net)), but do not include satisfactorily the effects of drought, impairing our capacity to simulate plant functioning in conditions of limited water supply. The objective of this review was to draw an up-to-date picture of the g(s) models, from the empirical to the process-based ones, along with their mechanistic or deterministic bases. It focuses on models capable to account for multiple environmental influences with emphasis on drought conditions. We examine how models that have been proposed for well-watered conditions can be combined with those specifically designed to deal with drought conditions. Ideas for future improvements of g(s) models are discussed: the issue of co-regulation of g(s) and A(net); the roles of CO(2), absissic acid and H(2)O(2); and finally, how to better address the new challenges arising from the issue of global change.},

	Abstract = {Herbivory can change the structure and spatial heterogeneity of vegetation. We ask whether all species of grazers in a savanna ecosystem can have this effect or whether megaherbivores ({\textgreater} 1000 kg) have a 'special' role that cannot be replicated by other species of grazers. We performed a replicated landscape scale experiment that examined the effects of White Rhino on the grass sward, on other species of grazing mammals and on the movement of fire through the landscape. White Rhino maintained short grass ('lawn') patches in mesic areas (similar to 750 mm pa) with increases in grass sward height when they were removed. Other species of grazers were unable to maintain short grass communities when White Rhino were removed. In semi-arid areas (similar to 600 mm pa) other, smaller grazers were able to maintain short grass communities in the absence of White Rhino and sward height did not increase. White Rhino removals affected fire by increasing fuel loads and fuel continuity. This resulted in larger, less patchy fires. We propose that the White Rhino acts as an influential ecosystem engineer, creating and maintaining short grass swards, which alter habitat for other grazers and change the fire regime. These results indicate the existence of context-dependent facilitation between White Rhino and other grazers in mesic, but not in semi-arid, savannas. Such top down effects on the ecosystem may have been much more widespread before the extinction of large grazers in the Pleistocene.},

The purpose of this review is to (1) state the essential and testable elements of the C-T theory, (2) summarize the negative evidence for the C-T theory, and (3) review critically the positive evidence for the C-T theory and the evidence that the Scholander-Hammel pressure bomb measures xylem pressure potential (Px) correctly, because much of the evidence for the C-T theory depends on pressure bomb data.
Much of the current evidence negates the conclusions drawn by Zimmermann from studies using the xylem pressure probe (XPP), but it is not yet clear in every instance why the XPP results disagree with those of other methods for estimating xylem pressure. There is no reason to reject the XPP as a useful new tool for studying xylem tensions in the range of 0 to --0.6 MPa.

	Abstract = {Competition and conflict among individuals can favour exploitative strategies that undermine the common good. Theory suggests that this can lead to a tragedy of the commons and ultimately population extinction, a phenomenon known as evolutionary suicide. Here, I present a model of the evolutionary tragedy of the commons that explicitly considers the population dynamics where individuals invest in individually costly competitive traits. In the simplest form, this supports the notion that selection for high levels of conflict can cause evolutionary suicide. However, as competition comes with survival and fecundity costs, a feedback between the investment in competition and population density can act to reduce the level of conflict and prevent the population from going extinct. This suggests that the interaction between population ecology and the evolution of competition and conflict among individuals may be an important mechanism in resolving the level of competition and conflict among individuals.},

	Abstract = {Upland tropical forests have expanded and contracted in response to past climates, but it is not clear whether similar dynamics were exhibited by gallery (riparian) forests within savanna biomes. Because such forests generally have access to ample water, their extent may be buffered against changing climates. We tested the long-term stability of gallery forest boundaries by characterizing the border between gallery forests and savannas and tracing the presence of gallery forest through isotopic analysis of organic carbon in the soil profile. We measured leaf area index, grass vs. shrub or tree coverage, the organic carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen and calcium concentrations in soils and the carbon isotope ratios of soil organic matter in two transitions spanning gallery forests and savanna in a Cerrado ecosystem. Gallery forests without grasses typically show a greater leaf area index in contrast to savannas, which show dense grass coverage. Soils of gallery forests have significantly greater concentrations of organic carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen and calcium than those of savannas. Soil organic carbon of savannas is significantly more enriched in C-13 compared with that of gallery forests. This difference in enrichment is in part caused by the presence of C-4 grasses in savanna ecosystem and its absence in gallery forests. Using the C-13 abundance as a signature for savanna and gallery forest ecosystems in 1 m soil cores, we show that the borders of gallery forests have expanded into the savanna and that this process initiated at least 3000-4000 BP based on C-14 analysis. Gallery forests, however, may be still expanding as we found more recent transitions according to C-14 activity measurements. We discuss the possible mechanisms of gallery forest expansion and the means by which nutrients required for the expansion of gallery forest might accumulate.},

	Abstract = {Global circulation models predict and numerous observations confirm that anthropogenic climate change has altered high-frequency climate variability. However, it is not yet well understood how changing patterns of environmental variation will affect wildlife population dynamics and other ecological processes. Theory predicts that a population's long-run growth rate is diminished and the chance of population extinction is increased as environmental variation increases. This results from the fact that population growth is a multiplicative process and that long-run population growth rate is the geometric mean of growth rates over time, which is always less than the arithmetic mean. However, when population growth rates for unstructured populations are related nonlinearly to environmental drivers, increasing environmental variation can increase a population's long-run growth rate. This suggests that patterns of environmental variation associated with different aspects of climate change may affect population dynamics in different ways. Specifically, increasing variation in rainfall might result in diminished long-run growth rates for many animal species while increasing variation in temperature might result in increased long-run growth rates. While the effect of rainfall is theoretically well understood and supported by data, the hypothesized effect of temperature is not. Here, I analyse two datasets to study the effect of fluctuating temperatures on growth rates of zooplankton. Results are consistent with the prediction that fluctuating temperatures should increase long-run growth rates and the frequency of extreme demographic events.},

Our results thus demonstrate convergent evolution and global generality in plant functioning, despite the enormous diversity of plant species and biomes. For 280 plant species from two global data sets, we found that potential carbon gain (photosynthesis) and carbon loss (respiration) increase in similar proportion with decreasing leaf life-span, increasing leaf nitrogen concentration, and increasing leaf surface area-to-mass ratio. Productivity of individual plants and of leaves in vegetation canopies also changes in constant proportion to leaf life-span and surface area-to-mass ratio. These global plant functional relationships have significant implications for global scale modeling of vegetation--atmosphere CO2 exchange.},

	Abstract = {Competition for light, treefall gap formation and recruitment are the critical phenomena in the genesis of tropical rain forests. These aspects are taken into account to build a new spatially explicit forest growth model called TROLL. Competition for light is modelled by calculating exactly the three-dimensional field of photosynthetically active radiation in the forest understorey. Typically, 10(6) light intensities are computed per hectare at each time step. This light field controls the growth of each tree and establishment/death events. Seed dispersal, dormancy and establishment success as well as a model of treefalls are also included. A special care is paid to the justification and to the validation of each of these modules. The TROLL model is parameterized for a Neotropical rain forest in French Guiana using 12 functional groups of species. Using this model the vertical canopy structure and the tree diametric distribution are investigated. The role of treefalls in maintaining pioneer species is also evidenced. A forest succession scenario is simulated and compared to field data. The model is then used to simulate the recolonization of a previously sterilized area by a rain forest plant community. This scenario is interpreted using information available from palaeorecords over the Holocene period and their validity is discussed. It is suggested that this model could be used to study mosaic-like patterns in rain forests, installation of slowly dispersing species, speciation hypotheses and landscape scale dynamics of rain forests.

Models involving both exploitative and pre-emptive competition have been proposed. We examine two of these models mathematically and show that neither can exhibit species diversity. The inclusion of random fruiting events, together with seedling population decay, can result in both models exhibiting long-term coexistence of many species. However, the parameter values required to simulate such behaviour are more realistic for the pre-emptive competition model than for the exploitative competition model. Our analysis has general implications for all tropical rain forests in that it suggests that a competition-colonisation type trade-off is not a sufficient condition for species coexistence.

	Abstract = {A fundamental goal of ecological research is to understand and model how processes generate patterns so that if conditions change, changes in the patterns can be predicted. Different approaches have been proposed for modelling species assemblage, but their use to predict spatial patterns of species richness and other community attributes over a range of spatial and temporal scales remains challenging. Different methods emphasize different processes of structuring communities and different goals. In this review, we focus on models that were developed for generating spatially explicit predictions of communities, with a particular focus on species richness, composition, relative abundance and related attributes. We first briefly describe the concepts and theories that span the different drivers of species assembly. A combination of abiotic processes and biotic mechanisms are thought to influence the community assembly process. In this review, we describe four categories of drivers: (i) historical and evolutionary, (ii) environmental, (iii) biotic, and (iv) stochastic. We discuss the different modelling approaches proposed or applied at the community level and examine them from different standpoints, i.e. the theoretical bases, the drivers included, the source data, and the expected outputs, with special emphasis on conservation needs under climate change. We also highlight the most promising novelties, possible shortcomings, and potential extensions of existing methods. Finally, we present new approaches to model and predict species assemblages by reviewing promising `integrative frameworks' and views that seek to incorporate all drivers of community assembly into a unique modelling workflow. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these new solutions and how they may hasten progress in community-level modelling.},

	Abstract = {Environmental change has altered the phenology, morphological traits and population dynamics of many species(1,2). However, the links underlying these joint responses remain largely unknown owing to a paucity of long-term data and the lack of an appropriate analytical framework(3). Here we investigate the link between phenotypic and demographic responses to environmental change using a new methodology and a long-term (1976-2008) data set from a hibernating mammal (the yellow-bellied marmot) inhabiting a dynamic subalpine habitat. We demonstrate how earlier emergence from hibernation and earlier weaning of young has led to a longer growing season and larger body masses before hibernation. The resulting shift in both the phenotype and the relationship between phenotype and fitness components led to a decline in adult mortality, which in turn triggered an abrupt increase in population size in recent years. Direct and trait-mediated effects of environmental change made comparable contributions to the observed marked increase in population growth. Our results help explain how a shift in phenology can cause simultaneous phenotypic and demographic changes, and highlight the need for a theory integrating ecological and evolutionary dynamics in stochastic environments(4,5).},

@article{hoffmann_fire_1999,
	Abstract = {Human activity has resulted in high fire frequency in many moist tropical savannas. To simulate the effects of increased fire frequency on woody plants of the cerrado savannas of Brazil, I constructed matrix population models for five species, including a subshrub, two shrubs, and two trees, using four years of demographic data. The models projected that four of the five species will decline under frequent burning but will increase in abundance under infrequent burning. For these four, fire intervals of 2--9 yr are required for long-term persistence, depending on the species. The fifth species, a shrub, was virtually unaffected by burning. Similar data for three herbaceous species were obtained from literature sources. Among the eight species, there was a negative relationship between population growth under annual burning and population growth under unburned conditions. Woody plant species performed best under low fire frequency, and herbaceous species performed best under high fire frequency. Three of the study species propagate vegetatively by producing root suckers. Fire stimulates vegetative propagation in all three species but reduces sexual reproduction. Elasticity analysis revealed that vegetative propagation is more important than sexual reproduction for population maintenance of these three species, and that vegetative propagation is relatively more important under frequent burning. However, stasis and progression were always much more important than either mode of reproduction, with stasis making the largest contribution to population growth. Analyses of life history response experiments were performed to determine what demographic variables contributed most to the population decline under frequent burning. The effect of fire on sexual reproduction contributed little to the overall effect of fire on population growth, particularly for clonal species. Fire-induced mortality also had little effect on population growth, except for Miconia albicans, which has extremely fire-sensitive seedlings. The negative effect of fire on individual size tended to make the greatest contribution to the overall negative effect of fire on population growth, and this effect was greater for the two trees than for the shrub species. The results indicate that growth form was the primary determinant of fire response, while ability to reproduce vegetatively is important to a lesser extent. Current fire regimes are predicted to reduce woody plant density and to favor smaller life forms and species capable of clonal propagation.},

	Abstract = {Cost-benefit analyses of foliar construction and maintenance costs and of carbon assimilation of leaves of differing life-span were conducted using two evergreen, three semi-deciduous, and three deciduous tree species of savannas of north Australia. Rates of radiant-energy-saturated CO2 assimilation (P-max) and dark respiration were measured and leaves were analysed for total nitrogen, fat, and ash concentrations, and for heat of combustion. Specific leaf area, and leaf N and ash contents were significantly lower in longer-lived leaves (evergreen) than shorter-lived leaves (deciduous) species. Leaves of evergreen species also had significantly higher heat of combustion and lower crude fat content than leaves of deciduous species. On a leaf area basis, P-max was highest in leaves of evergreen species, but on a leaf dry mass basis it was highest in leaves of deciduous species. P-max and total Kjeldahl N content were linearly correlated across all eight species, and foliar N content was higher in leaves of deciduous than evergreen species. Leaf construction cost was significantly higher and maintenance costs were lower for leaves of evergreen than deciduous species. Maintenance and construction costs were linearly related to each other across all species. Leaves of evergreen species had a higher cost-benefit ratio compared to leaves of deciduous species but with longer lived leaves, the payback interval was longer in evergreen than deciduous species. These results support the hypotheses that longer lived leaves are more expensive to construct than short-lived leaves, and that a higher investment of N into short-lived leaves occurs which supports a higher P-max over a shorter payback interval.},

@article{kicklighter_first-order_1999,
	Abstract = {We compared the simulated responses of net primary production, heterotrophic respiration, net ecosystem production and carbon storage in natural terrestrial ecosystems to historical (1765 to 1990) and projected (1990 to 2300) changes of atmospheric CO2 concentration of four terrestrial biosphere models: the Bern model, the Frankfurt Biosphere Model (FBM), the High-Resolution Biosphere Model (HRBM) and the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM). The results of the model intercomparison suggest that CO2 fertilization of natural terrestrial vegetation has the potential to account for a large fraction of the so-called "missing carbon sink" of 2.0 Pg C in 1990. Estimates of this potential are reduced when the models incorporate the concept that CO2 fertilization can be limited by nutrient availability. Although the model estimates differ on the potential size (126 to 461 Pg C) of the future terrestrial sink caused by CO2 fertilization, the results of the four models suggest that natural terrestrial ecosystems will have a limited capacity to act as a sink of atmospheric CO2 in the future as a result of physiological constraints and nutrient constraints on NPP. All the spatially explicit models estimate a carbon sink in both tropical and northern temperate regions, but the strength of these sinks varies over time. Differences in the simulated response of terrestrial ecosystems to CO2 fertilization among the models in this intercomparison study reflect the fact that the models have highlighted different aspects of the effect of CO2 fertilization on carbon dynamics of natural terrestrial ecosystems including feedback mechanisms. As interactions with nitrogen fertilization, climate change and forest regrowth may play an important role in simulating the response of terrestrial ecosystems to CO2 fertilization, these factors should be included in future analyses. Improvements in spatially explicit data sets, whole-ecosystem experiments and the availability of net carbon exchange measurements across the globe will also help to improve future evaluations of the role of CO2 fertilization on terrestrial carbon storage.},

	Abstract = {Many recent advances in the theory of the optimal economic exploitation of renewable fish resources have been gained by applying optimal control theory. However, despite these successes, much less is known about how seasonal environments affect the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) (or population persistence) and any effects of relations between intensity and frequency of harvesting. Assuming that fish populations follow Beverton-Holt equations we investigated impulsive harvesting in seasonal environments, focusing on both economic aspects and resource sustainability. We first investigated the existence and stability of a periodic solution and its analytic formula, and then showed that the population persistence depends on the intensity and frequency of harvesting. With the MSY as a management objective, we investigated optimal impulsive harvesting policies. The optimal harvesting effort that maximizes the sustainable yield, the corresponding optimal population level, and the MSY are obtained by using discrete Euler-Lagrange equations and product formulae, and their explicit expressions were obtained in terms of the intrinsic growth rate, the carrying capacity, and the impulsive moments. These results imply that harvest timing is of crucial importance to the MSY Since impulsive differential equations incorporate elements of continuous and discrete systems, we can apply all results obtained for Beverton-Holt equations with impulsive effects to periodic logistic equations with impulsive harvesting.

In contrast, we show the surprising extent to which variation in D t and wood structure is linked to support against implosion by negative pressure in the xylem pipeline. The more drought-tolerant the plant, the more negative the xylem pressure can become without cavitation, and the greater the internal load on the xylem conduit walls. Accordingly, D t was correlated with cavitation resistance. This trend was consistent with the maintenance of a safety factor from implosion by negative pressure: conduit wall span (b) and thickness (t) scaled so that (t/b)2 was proportional to cavitation resistance as required to avoid wall collapse. Unexpectedly, trends in D t may be as much or more related to support of the xylem pipeline as to support of the plant.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the processes that underlie species diversity and abundance in a community is a fundamental issue in community ecology. While the species abundance distributions (SADs) of various natural communities may be well explained by Hubbell's neutral model, it has been repeatedly pointed out that Hubbell's SAD-fitting approach lacks the ability to detect the effects of non-neutral factors such as niche differentiation; however, our understanding of its quantitative effect is limited. Herein, we conducted extensive simulations to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the SAD-fitting method and other recently developed tests. For simulations, we developed a niche model that incorporates the random stochastic demography of individuals and the nonrandom replacements of those individuals, i.e. niche differentiation. It therefore allows us to explore situations with various degrees of niche differentiation. We found that niche differentiation has strong effects on SADs and the number of species in the community under this model. We then examined the performance of these neutrality tests, including Hubbell's SAD-fitting method, using extensive simulations. It was demonstrated that all these tests have relatively poor performance except for the cases with very strong niche structure, which is in accordance with previous studies. This is likely because two important parameters in Hubbell's model are usually unknown and are commonly estimated from the data to be tested. To demonstrate this point, we showed that the precise estimation of the two parameters substantially improved the performance of these neutrality tests, indicating that poor performance can be owed to overfitting Hubbell's neutral model with unrealistic parameters. Our results therefore emphasize the importance of accurate parameter estimation, which should be obtained from data independent of the local community to be tested.},

@article{riginos_savanna_2008,
	Abstract = {Herbivores choose their habitats both to maximize forage intake and to minimize their risk of predation. For African savanna herbivores, the available habitats range in woody cover from open areas with few trees to dense, almost-closed woodlands. This variation in woody cover or density can have a number of consequences for herbaceous species composition, cover, and productivity, as well as for ease of predator detection and avoidance. Here, we consider two alternative possibilities: first, that tree density affects the herbaceous vegetation, with concomitant "bottom-up'' effects on herbivore habitat preferences; or, second, that tree density affects predator visibility, mediating "top-down'' effects of predators on herbivore habitat preferences. We sampled sites spanning a 10-fold range of tree densities in an Acacia drepanolobium-dominated savanna in Laikipia, Kenya, for variation in (1) herbaceous cover, composition, and species richness; (2) wild and domestic herbivore use; and (3) degree of visibility obstruction by the tree layer. We then used structural equation modeling to consider the potential influences that tree density may have on herbivores and herbaceous community properties. Tree density was associated with substantial variation in herbaceous species composition and richness. Cattle exhibited a fairly uniform use of the landscape, whereas wild herbivores, with the exception of elephants, exhibited a strong preference for areas of low tree density. Model results suggest that this was not a response to variation in herbaceous-community characteristics, but rather a response to the greater visibility associated with more open places. Elephants, in contrast, preferred areas with higher densities of trees, apparently because of greater forage availability. These results suggest that, for all but the largest species, top-down behavioral effects of predator avoidance on herbivores are mediated by tree density. This, in turn, appears to have cascading effects on the herbaceous vegetation. These results shed light on one of the major features of the "landscape of fear'' in which African savanna herbivores exist.},

	Abstract = {Division of labor among functionally specialized modules occurs at all levels of biological organization in both animals and plants. Well-known examples include the evolution of specialized enzymes after gene duplication, the evolution of specialized cell types, limb diversification in arthropods, and the evolution of specialized colony members in many taxa of marine invertebrates and social insects. Here, we identify conditions favoring the evolution of division of labor by means of a general mathematical model. Our starting point is the assumption that modules contribute to two different biological tasks and that the potential of modules to contribute to these tasks is traded off. Our results are phrased in terms of properties of performance functions that map the phenotype of modules to measures of performance. We show that division of labor is favored by three factors: positional effects that predispose modules for one of the tasks, accelerating performance functions, and synergistic interactions between modules. If modules can be lost or damaged, selection for robustness can counteract selection for functional specialization. To illustrate our theory we apply it to the evolution of specialized enzymes coded by duplicated genes.},

	Abstract = {Aim  To determine the functional relationships between, and the relative importance of, different driver variables (mean annual precipitation, soil properties, fire and herbivory) in regulating woody plant cover across broad environmental gradients in African savannas. Location  Savanna grasslands of East, West and Southern Africa. Methods  The dependence of woody cover on mean annual precipitation (MAP), soil properties (texture, nitrogen mineralization potential and total phosphorus), fire regimes, and herbivory (grazer, browser + mixed feeder, and elephant biomass) was determined for 161 savanna sites across Africa using stochastic gradient boosting, a refinement of the regression tree analysis technique. Results  All variables were significant predictors of woody cover, collectively explaining 71\% of the variance in our data set. However, their relative importance as regulators of woody cover varied. MAP was the most important predictor, followed by fire return periods, soil characteristics and herbivory regimes. Woody cover showed a strong positive dependence on MAP between 200 and 700 mm, but no dependence on MAP above this threshold when the effects of other predictors were accounted for. Fires served to reduce woody cover below rainfall-determined levels. Woody cover showed a complex, non-linear relationship with total soil phosphorus, and was negatively correlated with clay content. There was a strong negative dependence of woody cover on soil nitrogen (N) availability, suggesting that increased N-deposition may cause shifts in savannas towards more grassy states. Elephants, mixed feeders and browsers had negative effects on woody cover. Grazers, on the other hand, depressed woody cover at low biomass, but favoured woody vegetation when their biomass exceeded a certain threshold. Main conclusions  Our results indicate complex and contrasting relationships between woody cover, rainfall, soil properties and disturbance regimes in savannas, and suggest that future environmental changes such as altered precipitation regimes, N-enrichment and elevated levels of CO2 are likely to have opposing, and potentially interacting, influences on the tree--grass balance in savannas.},

For any combination of parameter values, we can identify which strategy is appropraite. As a corollary to this, we predict that small changes in ecolgical conditions can, under some circumstances, cause a dramatic change in the aggressive behavior of individuals. Further, we investigate situations where searching for undiscovered food and searching for potential opportunities for stealing are mutually exclusive activities (i.e., success at one can only be improved at the expense of the other). Using game theory, we are able to find the evolutionarily stable strategy for investment in these two activities in terms of the ecological parameters of the model.},

@article{hickler_projecting_2012,
	Abstract = {Aim  To assess the extent to which climate change might cause changes in potential natural vegetation (PNV) across Europe.
Location  Europe.
Method  We parameterized a generalized dynamic vegetation model (LPJ-GUESS) for the most common European tree species, and, for the first time, modelled large-scale vegetation dynamics using a process-based model explicitly representing tree species, age cohorts, gap dynamics and biogeochemical cycles in a single framework. For projections, the model was driven with climate scenario data from two atmosphere--ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs), downscaled to 10 × 10′ spatial resolution (c. 18.5 × 12 km at 50$\,^{\circ}$ N).
Results  At a general level, modelled present-day PNV corresponded better with an expert reconstruction of the PNV than most earlier plant functional type (PFT)-based simulations, but at a finer scale the model and the expert map showed substantial discrepancies in some areas. Simulations until 2085 showed considerable successional shifts in vegetation types in most areas: 31--42\% of the total area of Europe was projected to be covered by a different vegetation type by the year 2085. In the long term, equilibrium changes are substantially larger: simulations with one climate scenario suggest that 76--80\% of the European land surface could exist within another PNV if climate was stabilized by the end of the century and vegetation had unlimited time to achieve equilibrium with the new climate. `Hotspots' of change include arctic and alpine ecosystems, where trees replace tundra in the model, and the transition zone between temperate broad-leaved and boreal conifer forest. In southern Europe, the model projected widespread shifts from forest to shrublands as a result of drought.
Main conclusions  The model presents a considerable advance in modelling dynamic changes in natural vegetation across Europe. Climate change might cause substantial changes in PNV across Europe, which should be considered in the management of reserves and forestry.},

	Abstract = {Leaf-level photosynthetic parameters of species in the closely related genera Eucalyptus and Corymbia were assessed along a strong rainfall gradient in northern Australia. Both instantaneous gas exchange measurements and leaf carbon isotope discrimination indicated little variation in intercellular CO(2) concentrations during photosynthesis (c(i)) in response to a decrease in mean annual precipitation from similar to 1700 mm to similar to 300 mm. Correlation between stomatal conductance and photosynthetic capacity contributed toward the maintenance of relatively constant c(i) among the sampled leaves, when assessed at ambient CO(2) concentration and photon irradiance similar to full sunlight. Leaf mass per area was the most plastic leaf trait along the rainfall gradient, showing a linear increase in response to decreasing mean annual precipitation. The maximum Rubisco carboxylation velocity, V(cmax), expressed on a leaf-area basis, showed a modest increase in response to decreasing rainfall. This modest increase in V(cmax) was associated with the strongly expressed increase in leaf mass per area. These results suggest that variation in ecosystem-level gas exchange during the dry season in north-Australian savannas will likely be dominated by changes in leaf area index in response to increasing aridity, rather than by changes in photosynthetic performance per unit leaf area.

	Abstract = {Savannas are defined based on vegetation structure, the central concept being a discontinuous tree cover in a continuous grass understorey. However, at the high-rainfall end of the tropical savanna biome, where heavily wooded mesic savannas begin to structurally resemble forests, or where tropical forests are degraded such that they open out to structurally resemble savannas, vegetation structure alone may be inadequate to distinguish mesic savanna from forest. Additional knowledge of the functional differences between these ecosystems which contrast sharply in their evolutionary and ecological history is required. Specifically, we suggest that tropical mesic savannas are predominantly mixed tree--C4 grass systems defined by fire tolerance and shade intolerance of their species, while forests, from which C4 grasses are largely absent, have species that are mostly fire intolerant and shade tolerant. Using this framework, we identify a suite of morphological, physiological and life-history traits that are likely to differ between tropical mesic savanna and forest species. We suggest that these traits can be used to distinguish between these ecosystems and thereby aid their appropriate management and conservation. We also suggest that many areas in South Asia classified as tropical dry forests, but characterized by fire-resistant tree species in a C4 grass-dominated understorey, would be better classified as mesic savannas requiring fire and light to maintain the unique mix of species that characterize them.},

	Abstract = {The increase in the global surface temperature is influenced by several factors including anthropogenic and natural emissions of CO2, and the ability of natural sequestration reservoirs in the Earth's oceans and land to absorb and store it. The CO2 absorption in these reservoirs is sensitive to changes in the global temperature and the atmospheric CO2 concentration, thus creating a feedback loop in the Earth's ecosystem, which complicates predictions of the overall impact of rising atmospheric CO2 levels on global warming. Here, we model this interaction through a positive feedback loop and utilize general circulation models (GCM) to quantify the coupling between the carbon-cycle and the global temperature. We validate the model by comparing its predictions with those from high fidelity simulations and historical records. Thereafter, we investigate the impact of anthropogenic CO2 sequestration on lowering the rate of increase in the global temperature and find that a reduction in global warming is more sensitive to larger sequestration fractions. Thus, an inordinately large fraction of CO2 emissions would have to be sequestered to significantly impact global warming. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

These shifts reflect changes in the mixing ratio of terrigenous carbon derived from C3 and C4 plants. The rapid increase in delta(13)C Of Bengal Fan OC at 7 Ma shows that Late Miocene expansion of C4 plants already documented in the Siwaliks was widespread over all the Himalayan foreland. After 7 Ma, relations of delta(13)C With sedimentological parameters show that C4 plants dominate in the foreland whereas C3 plants remain abundant in the mountain range. Variations in the source of the sediments and of the OC appear to be sensitive to climate-hydrologic conditions in the basin.

Recent advances in SDMs allow us to potentially forecast anthropogenic effects on patterns of biodiversity at different spatial scales. However, some limitations still preclude the use of SDMs in many theoretical and practical applications. Here, we provide an overview of recent advances in this field, discuss the ecological principles and assumptions underpinning SDMs, and highlight critical limitations and decisions inherent in the construction and evaluation of SDMs. Particular emphasis is given to the use of SDMs for the assessment of climate change impacts and conservation management issues. We suggest new avenues for incorporating species migration, population dynamics, biotic interactions and community ecology into SDMs at multiple spatial scales. Addressing all these issues requires a better integration of SDMs with ecological theory.},

Large swathes of forest are removed each year, and many models have attempted to predict the spatial patterns of this forest loss. The spatial patterns of deforestation are determined largely by the patterns of roads that open access to frontier areas and expansion of the road network in the Amazon is largely determined by profit seeking logging activities. Here we present predictions for the spatial distribution of standing value of timber across the Amazon. We show that the patterns of timber value reflect large-scale ecological gradients, determining the spatial distribution of functional traits of trees which are, in turn, correlated with timber values. We expect that understanding the spatial patterns of timber value across the Amazon will aid predictions of logging movements and thus predictions of potential future road developments. These predictions in turn will be of great use in estimating the spatial patterns of deforestation in this globally important biome.},

@article{eamus_cost-benefit_1998,
	Abstract = {We conducted a cost-benefit analysis of the contrasting phenologies of two evergreen and two deciduous species of the savannas of north Australia. Stomatal conductance, rates of light-saturated assimilation (A(max)) and dark respiration were measured for six leaves from each of five or six trees. These leaves were then analyzed for total nitrogen, ether-soluble lipids, ash content, and heat of combustion. Construction and maintenance costs, nitrogen-use efficiencies and instantaneous transpiration efficiencies were then calculated from these data. Evergreen species had significantly lower specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen and leaf ash content than deciduous species. Evergreen species also had significantly higher heat of combustion and lipid content of crude extracts than deciduous species. Light-saturated assimilation rates were higher in evergreen species on a leaf area basis, but were higher in deciduous species on a leaf dry weight basis. In both evergreen and deciduous species, A(max) and total Kjeldahl nitrogen were linearly related. Similarly, nitrogen-use efficiency did not differ among species. Leaf construction costs were significantly higher for evergreen species than for deciduous species, but maintenance costs did not differ among species. Evergreen species had a higher cost:benefit ratio than deciduous species but because of their longer-lived leaves, the payback interval was longer in evergreen species than in deciduous species. These results support the hypotheses that: (1) longer-lived leaves are more expensive to construct than shorter-lived leaves, and (2) there is a higher investment of nitrogen into short-lived leaves to support a higher A(max) over a shorter payback interval. We conclude that deciduous and evergreen species partition resources both temporally and spatially, thereby reducing interspecies competition.},

The approximated stable manifold represents a 'successional threshold' measuring the resilience of the rangeland ecosystem in recovering from historic overgrazing.

	Abstract = {Decisions to reduce the impacts of large herbivores on biodiversity in protected areas are often based on controlling their numbers. However, numbers per se may not be the foremost consideration when managing impacts. This is because density-related changes in distribution can also affect habitat utilization and hence, impact. In this study we tested whether changes in the distribution of African elephants are associated with increasing population size. We used spatially explicit count data collected during the dry seasons from 1998 to 2004 in South Africa's Kruger National Park. We did this at five spatial scales and in landscapes defined by vegetation, geology, climate and soils. We then investigated whether observed distributions and grid-cell-specific densities were associated with the remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a measure of productivity and therefore food resource availability at the landscape scale. Consistent with density mediated changes, we found that elephant grid-cell occupancy increased with population size, while grid-cell-specific density became less variable. In addition, the combined distribution of bull groups and breeding herds became less clumped with increasing population size. We further found that within landscapes elephants were present on grid-cells with higher NDVI values, but that the influence of NDVI during the dry season on densities among landscapes may be weak. These results suggest that NDVI was more indicative of structural habitat choices such as woody vegetation than food availability per se. Our study highlights the need to consider factors other than population size alone when formulating management decisions to reduce large herbivore impacts on biodiversity in protected areas.},

* * To determine climate potential, we simulated vegetation without fire using a dynamic global-vegetation model. Model results were tested against fire exclusion studies from different parts of the world. Simulated dominant growth forms and tree cover were compared with satellite-derived land- and tree-cover maps.
* * Simulations were generally consistent with results of fire exclusion studies in southern Africa and elsewhere. Comparison of global `fire off' simulations with landcover and treecover maps show that vast areas of humid C4 grasslands and savannas, especially in South America and Africa, have the climate potential to form forests. These are the most frequently burnt ecosystems in the world. Without fire, closed forests would double from 27\% to 56\% of vegetated grid cells, mostly at the expense of C4 plants but also of C3 shrubs and grasses in cooler climates.

We investigated the combined effects of atmospheric [CO2] and herbivory on synthesised plant communities growing on soils of different fertility. Factorial combinations of two [CO2] (350 or 700 mu l l(-1)), two fertility (fertilised or non-fertilised), and two herbivory (herbivores present or absent) treatments were applied to a standard mixture of seven fast- and eight slow-growing plants in outdoor microcosms. The herbivores used were the grain aphid (Sitobion avenae) and the garden snail (Helix aspersa). We measured plant biomass, foliar nitrogen and soluble tannin concentration, aphid fecundity, and snail growth, fecundity, and feeding preferences over one growing season. Elevated [CO2] did not have a significant impact on(1)the combined biomass of fast-growing or slow-growing plants, (2) herbivore feeding preferences, or (3) herbivore fitness. There was, however, a significant biomass increase of Carex flacca (which represented in all cases less than 5\% of total live biomass), and some chemical changes in unpalatable plants under elevated [CO2]. The herbivory treatment significantly increased the biomass of slow-growing plants over fast-growing plants, whereas fertilisation significantly increased the abundance of fast-growing plants over slow-growing plants. Predictions on the effects of elevated [CO2] based on published single-species experiments were not supported by the results of this microcosm study.},

	Abstract = {Woody plants may be killed by severe disturbance or resprout from vegetative tissue. Sprouters can persist at a site through several generations of nonsprouters. Differences in sprouting behavior are therefore important for understanding vegetation dynamics, extinction risks, and woody plant management. Although sprouting appears not to be uniquely correlated with many other intrinsic attributes, such as specific leaf area or breeding systems, a clear correlate is reduced seedling aboveground growth rates from sprouters allocating more to belowground structures. Consequently, sprouters tend to have low seedling recruitment rates, and saplings take longer to reach maturity. Sprouters also tend to have lower seed output than nonsprouters, but comparative studies have seldom taken other trait differences such as plant size into account. Added to these trade-offs between persistence and recruitment, sprouters are often multistemmed and shorter than related nonsprouters and may be outcompeted by them when disturbances are rare. Since sprouters tend to have long generation times, damped demographic trends, and gene flow across generations, it has been suggested that their speciation rates would be low. The available data, primarily from fire-prone Gondwanan shrublands in South Africa, show no strong differences in speciation rates of related sprouters versus seeders. This indicates that ecological factors are important determinants of the evolution of fire life histories. Analysis of disturbance regimes indicates a fundamental ecological correlate: sprouters are favored where disturbance regimes are frequent and severe in comparison to regrowth rates. To bridge the gap between ecology and evolution, data are needed on the genetical differences between related species with contrasting sprouter life histories.},

	Abstract = {Questions: Density dependence is thought to restrict exponential growth as well as give rise to size structure in populations. Size hierarchy in trees from tropical dry deciduous forests is studied to ask (1) whether nature of competition is symmetric or asymmetric and (2) what is the self thinning trajectory under a natural gradient of tree density. Location: Western India. Methods: Density was measured as the number of trees in 10-m radius circular plots (n = 96) and size was measured at DBH. Size variation was evaluated by the Gini coefficient (n = 1239 trees). Results: Size inequality between neighbours decreased with density but in a non-linear manner. In the backdrop of existing theory this indirectly suggests that competitive interactions may be symmetric over a 'depletive' resource such as below-ground water (rather than a 'pre-emptive' resource such as light), which is very plausible in a semi-arid environment. The self thinning coefficient derived from the relationship between stem diameter and density (y approximate to -1/4), is higher than expected from existing models of allometric plant growth (y approximate to -1/3) which are based on above-ground interactions alone. Seen in conjunction, these results suggest that above-ground structures, such as stem size, do not adequately represent the outcome of competitive interactions when below-ground resources, such as water, may be more important under semi-arid conditions. Conclusions: The non-linear relationship between size inequality and density indicates that there exists a density threshold beyond which investment in above-ground biomass becomes sluggish in semi-arid, deciduous forests. Since current allometric models do not incorporate below-ground biomass for trees, these data suggest that a more comprehensive allometric growth model may have higher predictive power and wider applicability.},

In this article we describe patterns of functional trait variation and trait correlations within and among habitats in relation to several environmental and trade‐off axes. We then ask whether such patterns reflect natural selection and can be considered plant strategies. In so doing we highlight evidence that demonstrates that (1) patterns of trait variation across resource and environmental gradients (light, water, nutrients, and temperature) probably reflect adaptation, (2) plant trait variation typically involves multiple‐correlated traits that arise because of inevitable trade‐offs among traits and across levels of whole‐plant integration and that must be understood from a whole‐plant perspective, and (3) such adaptation may be globally generalizable for like conditions; i.e., the set of traits (collections of traits in syndromes) of taxa can be considered as ``plant strategies.''},

	Abstract = {Atmospheric changes such as elevated CO2 are of global extent, exert prime influences in the remaining wilderness areas, and are second in importance only to effects of land use on ecosystems in most parts of the world. This study is an attempt to summarize, from a biological viewpoint, knowledge of the influences of atmospheric CO2 enrichment on terrestrial ecosystems, as derived from empirical data. I first briefly recall key aspects of the global carbon cycle, mention important conceptual aspects and research tools, and then discuss in greater depth how elevated CO2 is likely to affect vegetation processes. Besides a stimulation of photosynthesis, the most robust findings on plant responses to elevated CO2 are changes in active tissue quality (wider C/N ratio) and effects on community dynamics. Results of experimental work offer a number of plausible projections with respect to future ecosystem processes and organismic interactions, but manipulative experiments appear unsuitable to prove or disprove C sequestration by terrestrial ecosystems. In certain regions, consequences of climatic changes and soluble-nitrogen deposition are likely to be greater than direct CO2 effects on the carbon balance of vegetation. The significance of the ecosystem approach, the use of fully coupled plant-soil systems, and the consideration of nonlinear responses are highlighted. The current understanding of the CO2 problem offers sufficient justification to urge measures for moderating human forcing of atmospheric change.},

	Abstract = {It has been suggested that increases in temperature can accelerate the decomposition of organic carbon contained in forest mineral soil (C-s), and, therefore, that global warming should increase the release of soil organic carbon to the atmosphere(1-6). These predictions assume, however, that decay constants can be accurately derived from short-term laboratory incubations of soil or that in situ incubations of fresh litter accurately represent the temperature sensitivity of C-s decomposition. But our limited understanding of the biophysical factors that control C-s decomposition rates, and observations of only minor increases in C-s decomposition rate with temperature in longer-term forest soil heating experiments(7-12) and in latitudinal comparisons of C-s decomposition rates(13-15) bring these predictions into question. Here we have compiled C-s decomposition data from 82 sites on five continents. We found that C-s decomposition rates were remarkably constant across a global-scale gradient in mean annual temperature. These data suggest that C-s decomposition rates for forest soils are not controlled by temperature limitations to microbial activity, and that increased temperature alone will not stimulate the decomposition of forest-derived carbon in mineral soil.},

	Abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Current thinking holds that wood density mediates a tradeoff between strength and economy of construction, with higher wood density providing higher strength but at higher cost. 2. Yet the further away wood fibres are from the central axis of the trunk, the more they increase the strength of the trunk; thus, a fat trunk of low-density wood can achieve greater strength at lower construction cost than a thin trunk of high-density wood. 3. What then are the countervailing advantages of high wood density? 4. We hypothesize that high wood density is associated with lower maintenance costs due to lower trunk surface area, as surface area correlates with maintenance respiration. 5. This advantage would be particularly important to long-lived trees and could in part explain why they tend to have high wood density. 6. High wood density has also been associated with lower risk of trunk breakage, xylem implosion and pathogen invasion, but we argue that these relationships are not causal and instead reflect correlated selection on other traits of value to long-lived trees. 7. This revaluation of the costs and benefits of high wood density has important implications for understanding tree life-history evolution, functional diversity, forest carbon stocks and the impacts of global change.},

@article{knorr_annual_2000,
	Abstract = {* 1Assessments of climate change impacts on the global carbon cycle have to rely on accurate models describing the contribution of the terrestrial biosphere. Interannual climate fluctuations provide an ideal test case for their reliability because results can be checked against atmospheric measurements. * 2Intercomparisons have so far shown rather large discrepancies between the results of different terrestrial ecosystem models, especially for net primary productivity (NPP). Therefore, identification of the processes contributing most to modelling uncertainties is another necessary step towards more reliable predictions. * 3The Biosphere Energy-Transfer and Hydrology model (BETHY) is used to simulate global photosynthesis, and plant and soil respiration embedded within the full energy and water balance, based on 13 years of meteorological data. A series of sensitivity experiments is defined to assess the effects of estimated global uncertainties in a range of parameters. * 4It is found that modelling uncertainties are responsible for a large range of computed values of global annual NPP, while interannual climate fluctuations create only relatively minor changes. These fluctuations, however, are responsible for imbalances between carbon uptake by and release from the terrestrial biosphere, creating interannual fluctuations of the net biosphere--atmosphere CO2 exchange. Here, different model versions tend to agree with each other, which indicates that the net flux is generally better constrained than average NPP. A comparison with net fluxes derived from atmospheric CO2 data shows a good agreement for most models. * 5The results support the hypothesis that at the time scale of a decade, the terrestrial biosphere causes most of the interannual fluctuations of atmospheric CO2 concentrations, with the tropics playing a dominant role. They also indicate that modelling uncertainties for the net carbon exchanges tend to be less pronounced than for NPP. The method presented here, applied to other modelling studies, should also help in the identification of major uncertainties in biosphere process description, eventually leading to improved predictive capabilities of such models.},

	Abstract = {We examine the evidence for the possibility that 21st-century climate change may cause a large-scale "dieback'' or degradation of Amazonian rainforest. We employ a new framework for evaluating the rainfall regime of tropical forests and from this deduce precipitation-based boundaries for current forest viability. We then examine climate simulations by 19 global climate models (GCMs) in this context and find that most tend to underestimate current rainfall. GCMs also vary greatly in their projections of future climate change in Amazonia. We attempt to take into account the differences between GCM-simulated and observed rainfall regimes in the 20th century. Our analysis suggests that dry-season water stress is likely to increase in E. Amazonia over the 21st century, but the region tends toward a climate more appropriate to seasonal forest than to savanna. These seasonal forests may be resilient to seasonal drought but are likely to face intensified water stress caused by higher temperatures and to be vulnerable to fires, which are at present naturally rare in much of Amazonia. The spread of fire ignition associated with advancing deforestation, logging, and fragmentation may act as nucleation points that trigger the transition of these seasonal forests into fire-dominated, low biomass forests. Conversely, deliberate limitation of deforestation and fire may be an effective intervention to maintain Amazonian forest resilience in the face of imposed 21st-century climate change. Such intervention may be enough to navigate E. Amazonia away from a possible "tipping point,'' beyond which extensive rainforest would become unsustainable.},

	Abstract = {Separate logistic regression models were developed to predict the distribution and large-scale spatial patterns of dominant graminoid species and communities in alpine grasslands. The models are driven by four bioclimatic parameters: degree-days of growing season (basis 0 degrees C), a moisture index for July, potential direct solar radiation for March, and a continentality index. Geology and slope angle were used as a surrogate for nutrient availability and soil water capacity. The bioclimatic parameters were derived from monthly mean temperature, precipitation, cloudiness and potential direct solar radiation. The environmental parameters were interpolated using a digital elevation model with a resolution of 50 m. The vegetation data for model calibration originate from field surveys and literature. An independent test data set with samples from three different climatic zones was used to test the model. The degree of coincidence between simulated and observed patterns was similar for species and communities, but the kappa-values for communities were generally higher (kappa = 0.539) than for species (mean individual kappa = 0.201). Information on land use was detected as a major factor that could significantly improve both the species and the community model. Nevertheless, the climatic factors used to drive the model explained a major part of the observed patterns.},

	Abstract = {The relative importance of niche-based (e.g., competitive or stress-based) and stochastic (e.g., random dispersal) processes in structuring ecological communities is frequently analyzed by studying trait distributions of co-occurring species. While filtering processes, such as the exclusion of stress-intolerant species from particular habitats, increase the trait similarity between co-occurring species, other processes, such as resource competition can limit the similarity of co-occurring species. Comparing the observed trait distribution patterns in communities to null-expectations from randomized communities (e.g. a draw of the same observed richness from the regional pool) gives therefore a first indication of the dominant process driving community assembly. However, such comparisons do not inform us about the relative contribution of these different processes in shaping community compositions in case of their joint operation (a likely scenario). Using an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach we develop a new method that allows inference of the relative importance of dispersal, filtering and limiting similarity processes for the assembly of observed communities with known species and trait composition. We applied this approach to a tree community dataset, collected across 20 plots along strong rainfall and fire gradients in a South African savanna. Based on comparisons with simulations, we find that our new approach is powerful in identifying which community assembly scenario has the highest probability to generate the observed trait distribution patterns, while traditional null model comparisons perform poorly in detecting signs of limiting similarity. For the studied savanna tree communities, our analysis yields that dispersal processes are most important in shaping the functional trait distribution patterns. Furthermore, our models indicate that filtering processes were relatively most important in areas with high fire frequencies, while limiting similarity processes were relatively most important in areas with low fire frequency and high rainfall. We conclude that our new method is a promising improvement on current approaches to estimate the relative importance of community assembly processes across different species groups, ecosystems and biomes. Future model modifications (e.g. the inclusion of individual-based processes) could provide further steps in uncovering the underlying assembly processes behind observed community patterns.},

In this paper we indirectly parameterize a theoretical model of savanna dynamics with the aim of gaining insights as to how the grass--tree balance changes across a broad biogeographical gradient. We use data on the abundance of trees in African savannas and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to estimate the model parameters. The analysis shows that grasses and trees can coexist over a broad range of rainfall regimes. Further, our results indicate that savannas may be regulated by either asymptotically stable dynamics (in the absence of fire) or by stable limit cycles (in the presence of fire). Rainfall does not influence which of these two classes of dynamics occurs. We conclude that, even though fire might not be necessary for grass--tree coexistence, it nonetheless is an important modifier of grass : tree ratios.},

	Abstract = {A key aspect of biodiversity is the great quantitative variation in functional traits observed among species. One perspective asserts that trait values should converge on a single optimum value in a particular selective environment, and consequently trait variation would reflect differences in selective environment, and evolutionary outcomes would be predictable. An alternative perspective asserts that there are likely multiple alternative optima within a particular selective environment, and consequently different lineages would evolve toward different optima due to chance. Because there is evidence for both of these perspectives, there is a long-standing controversy over the relative importance of convergence due to environmental selection versus divergence due to chance in shaping trait variation. Here, I use a model of tree seedling growth and survival to distinguish trait variation associated with multiple alternative optima from variation associated with environmental differences. I show that variation in whole plant traits is best explained by environmental differences, whereas in organ level traits variation is more affected by alternative optima. Consequently, I predict that in nature variation in organ level traits is most closely related to phylogeny, whereas variation in whole plant traits is most closely related to ecology.},

@article{romermann_predicting_2007,
	Abstract = {Aim Species frequency data have been widely used in nature conservation to aid management decisions. To determine species frequencies, information on habitat occurrence is important: a species with a low frequency is not necessarily rare if it occupies all suitable habitats. Often, information on habitat distribution is available for small geographic areas only. We aim to predict grid-based habitat occurrence from grid-based plant species distribution data in a meso-scale analysis. Location The study was carried out over two spatial extents: Germany and Bavaria. Methods Two simple models were set up to examine the number of characteristic plant species needed per grid cell to predict the occurrence of four selected habitats (species data from FlorKart, http://www.floraweb.de). Both models were calibrated in Bavaria using available information on habitat distribution, validated for other federal states, and applied to Germany. First, a spatially explicit regression model (generalized linear model (GLM) with assumed binomial error distribution of response variable) was obtained. Second, a spatially independent optimization model was derived that estimated species numbers without using spatial information on habitat distribution. Finally, an additional uncalibrated model was derived that calculated the frequencies of 24 habitats. It was validated using NATURA2000 habitat maps. Results Using the Bavarian models it was possible to predict habitat distribution and frequency from the co-occurrence of habitat-specific species per grid cell. As the model validations for other German federal states were successful, the models were applied to all of Germany, and habitat distribution and frequencies could be retrieved for the national scale on the basis of habitat-specific species co-occurrences per grid cell. Using the third, uncalibrated model, which includes species distribution data only, it was possible to predict the frequencies of 24 habitats based on the co-occurrence of 24\% of formation-specific species per grid cell. Predicted habitat frequencies deduced from this third model were strongly related to frequencies of NATURA2000 habitat maps. Main conclusions It was concluded that it is possible to deduce habitat distributions and frequencies from the co-occurrence of habitat-specific species. For areas partly covered by habitat mappings, calibrated models can be developed and extrapolated to larger areas. If information on habitat distribution is completely lacking, uncalibrated models can still be applied, providing coarse information on habitat frequencies. Predicted habitat distributions and frequencies can be used as a tool in nature conservation, for example as correction factors for species frequencies, as long as the species of interest is not included in the model set-up.},

	Abstract = {We develop and compare two hydraulically-based schemes of the xylem structure of an individual plant. The dynamics of water uptake are analyzed under random conditions through the modeling of rainfall as a stochastic process. The two hydraulic schemes differ in the modeling of the root ability to cooperate, i.e., the capacity of roots to increase the water uptake from the wetter soil layers when other parts of the soil are dry (compensation effect) and to transfer water from moister into drier soil layers (water redistribution effect). Both compensation and water redistribution are direct consequences of the hydraulic structure of the root system, which is modeled here considering two contrasting cases corresponding to non-interacting uptake paths from different soil layers, and converging uptake paths. Only the latter hydraulic architecture allows for compensation and water redistribution. Another important difference between the hydraulic schemes is the stomatal response to soil dryness. When the soil water is unevenly distributed in the soil layers, the differences in the hydraulic schemes emerge. In semi-arid climates, plants characterized by a cooperative root system are shown to be less prone to water stress. In contrast, plants with non-interacting roots result to be better fit to humid climates, where the probability of droughts is small.},

	Abstract = {Dynamic vegetation models provide process-based explanations of the dynamics and the distribution of plant ecosystems. They offer significant advantages over static, correlative modelling approaches, particularly for ecosystems that are outside their equilibrium due to global change or climate change. A persistent problem, however, is their parameterization. Parameters and processes of dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) are traditionally determined independently of the model, while model outputs are compared to empirical data for validation and informal model comparison only. But field data for such independent estimates of parameters and processes are often difficult to obtain, and the desire to include better descriptions of processes such as biotic interactions, dispersal, phenotypic plasticity and evolution in future vegetation models aggravates limitations related to the current parameterization paradigm. In this paper, we discuss the use of Bayesian methods to bridge this gap. We explain how Bayesian methods allow direct estimates of parameters and processes, encoded in prior distributions, to be combined with inverse estimates, encoded in likelihood functions. The combination of direct and inverse estimation of parameters and processes allows a much wider range of vegetation data to be used simultaneously, including vegetation inventories, species traits, species distributions, remote sensing, eddy flux measurements and palaeorecords. The possible reduction of uncertainty regarding structure, parameters and predictions of DVMs may not only foster scientific progress, but will also increase the relevance of these models for policy advice.},

To quantify the degree to which functional differentiation among species affects their litter decomposition rates, we brought together leaf trait and litter mass loss data for 818 species from 66 decomposition experiments on six continents. We show that: (i) the magnitude of species-driven differences is much larger than previously thought and greater than climate-driven variation; (ii) the decomposability of a species' litter is consistently correlated with that species' ecological strategy within different ecosystems globally, representing a new connection between whole plant carbon strategy and biogeochemical cycling. This connection between plant strategies and decomposability is crucial for both understanding vegetation-soil feedbacks, and for improving forecasts of the global carbon cycle.},

	Abstract = {Approximately 8000 km(2) of Brazilian Amazon forest are selectively logged each year. Although virgin forest in eastern Amazonia is generally immune to fire, selectively logged forests are susceptible to fire. In eastern Amazonia we employed permanent-plot studies, forest fuel moisture measurements, and hemispheric canopy photographs to study the impacts of fire on a selectively logged forest, the microclimatic conditions that foster forest fires, and the measures that loggers might take to reduce fire incidence. Significant tree mortality followed a typical ground fire in a selectively logged forest. Forty-four percent of all trees greater than or equal to 10 cm in diameter at breast height died in a burned plot while only 3\% died in an unburned plot. In large logging gaps the density of regenerating pioneer species increased by {\textgreater}60\% in burned plots 15 mo after the fire, while it decreased by {\textgreater}40\% in unburned plots. The rate of fuel drying in selectively logged forest was influenced by photon flux density (PFD), time since logging, and logging techniques. There was a significant (P = 0.005) negative correlation between PFD and the number of days fuel sticks required to reach the point where fire could spread. In a recently logged forest, large logging gaps ({\textgreater}700 m(2)) reached fire susceptibility after 6 d, and medium-sized logging gaps (approximate to 200-700 m(2)) reached fire susceptibility after 15 d. But fire susceptibility declines over time as logging gaps become densely packed with saplings; fuel moisture conditions in large gaps of forest selectively logged 4 yr earlier were similar to those found in virgin forest, thus reducing the likelihood of fire. Careful logging also can reduce the likelihood of fire. Special low-impact logging techniques remove the same amount of timber as do the more typical high-impact logging techniques, but fire is significantly less likely because the more careful operation avoids the creation of large logging gaps, the most fire susceptible areas.},

Our analysis does not assign probabilities to scenarios or weights to models. Instead, we consider distribution of outcomes within three sets of model runs grouped by the amount of global warming they simulate: {\textless} 2 degrees C (including simulations in which atmospheric composition is held constant, i.e., in which the only climate change is due to greenhouse gases already emitted), 2-3 degrees C, and {\textgreater} 3 degrees C. High risk of forest loss is shown for Eurasia, eastern China, Canada, Central America, and Amazonia, with forest extensions into the Arctic and semiarid savannas; more frequent wildfire in Amazonia, the far north, and many semiarid regions; more runoff north of 50 degrees N and in tropical Africa and northwestern South America; and less runoff in West Africa, Central America, southern Europe, and the eastern U.S. Substantially larger areas are affected for global warming {\textgreater} 3 degrees C than for {\textless} 2 degrees C; some features appear only at higher warming levels. A land carbon sink of approximate to 1 Pg of C per yr is simulated for the late 20th century, but for {\textgreater} 3 degrees C this sink converts to a carbon source during the 21st century (implying a positive climate feedback) in 44\% of cases. The risks continue increasing over the following 200 years, even with atmospheric composition held constant.},

	Abstract = {The tropical savanna landscape of northern Australia is perhaps the most extensive and flammable ecosystem in the world. Like savannas worldwide, there still remains uncertainty as to the functioning of much of this system and the mechanisms maintaining a state between open grassland and woodland. We use the development of a process-based model to examine the processes operating on the eucalypt dominated tree component of the northern Australian savannas, focussing on the interaction of water availability and fire. A process-based, tree population dynamics model (FLAMES) has been developed to understand the interactive effects of fire and rainfall variability on trees in Australian savanna ecosystems where there has been limited modelling to date. This paper shows that the model is capable of simulating the range of tree populations found in northern Australia by considering soil properties (texture and depth) and rainfall distribution. The model indicates that seasonal variability and inter-annual variability in rainfall is critical in defining the structure and density of tree stands in northern Australia. We also show that fire plays an important role in defining tree structure by removing the most sensitive (the very young and old) trees and that frequent fronting fires will lead to ongoing reductions in tree populations. While fire is an important factor in northern Australia, the model indicates its effects on tree populations at a sub-continental scale are secondary to the impact of rainfall variability.

@article{svanback_intraspecific_2007,
	Abstract = {Resource competition is thought to play a major role in driving evolutionary diversification. For instance, in ecological character displacement, coexisting species evolve to use different resources, reducing the effects of interspecific competition. It is thought that a similar diversifying effect might occur in response to competition among members of a single species. Individuals may mitigate the effects of intraspecific competition by switching to use alternative resources not used by conspecific competitors. This diversification is the driving force in some models of sympatric speciation, but has not been demonstrated in natural populations. Here, we present experimental evidence confirming that competition drives ecological diversification within natural populations. We manipulated population density of three-spine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in enclosures in a natural lake. Increased population density led to reduced prey availability, causing individuals to add alternative prey types to their diet. Since phenotypically different individuals added different alternative prey, diet variation among individuals increased relative to low-density control enclosures. Competition also increased the diet--morphology correlations, so that the frequency-dependent interactions were stronger in high competition. These results not only confirm that resource competition promotes niche variation within populations, but also show that this increased diversity can arise via behavioural plasticity alone, without the evolutionary changes commonly assumed by theory.},

It is difficult to answer definitively because we have so many (at least 120) plausible hypotheses. This abundance of hypotheses has led to a number of attempts to classify them. Unfortunately, richness hypotheses often defy such categorization. Instead of placing species richness hypotheses into categories, I suggest an alternative approach: to treat species richness hypotheses as violations of the assumptions of Gause's Competitive Exclusion Principle. This is a very similar approach to the pedagogy of population genetics: evolution occurs if and only if at least one assumption of the Hardy-Weinberg principle is violated. The classification of hypotheses advocated here treats interspecific competition as a central organizing concept in community theory. However, it does not treat competition as an organizing concept in communities: indeed, the relaxation or disruption of competition is considered to be the status quo in the majority of communities.},

The extent and structural complexity of Amazon forests impedes ground studies of ecosystem functions such as net primary production (NPP), water cycling, and carbon sequestration. Traditional modeling and remote-sensing approaches are not well suited to tropical forest studies, because (i) biophysical mechanisms determining drought effects on canopy water and carbon dynamics are poorly known, and (ii) remote-sensing metrics of canopy greenness may be insensitive to small changes in leaf area accompanying drought. New spaceborne imaging spectroscopy may detect drought stress in tropical forests, helping to monitor forest physiology and constrain carbon models. We combined a forest drought experiment in Amaz{\^o}nia with spaceborne imaging spectrometer measurements of this area. With field data on rainfall, soil water, and leaf and canopy responses, we tested whether spaceborne hyperspectral observations quantify differences in canopy water and NPP resulting from drought stress. We found that hyperspectral metrics of canopy water content and light-use efficiency are highly sensitive to drought. Using these observations, forest NPP was estimated with greater sensitivity to drought conditions than with traditional combinations of modeling, remote-sensing, and field measurements. Spaceborne imaging spectroscopy will increase the accuracy of ecological studies in humid tropical forests.},

Researchers across disciplines have observed shifting phenology at multiple scales, including earlier spring flowering in individual plants and an earlier spring green-up' of the land surface revealed in satellite images. Experimental and modeling approaches have sought to identify the mechanisms causing these shifts, as well as to make predictions regarding the consequences. Here, we discuss recent advances in several fields that have enabled scaling between species responses to recent climatic changes and shifts in ecosystem productivity, with implications for global carbon cycling.},

However, as a xylem conduit is filled with gas during cavitation, water is freed to the transpiration stream and this transiently increases xylem water potential. This capacitive effect of embolism formation on plant function has not been explicitly quantified in the past. A dynamic model is presented that models xylem water potential, xylem sap flow and cavitation, taking into account both the decreasing hydraulic conductance and the water release effect of xylem embolism. The significance of the capacitive effect increases in relation to the decreasing hydraulic conductance effect when transpiration rate is low in relation to the total amount of water in xylem conduits. This ratio is typically large in large trees and during drought.},

	Abstract = {We outline a method of inferring rooting depth from a Terrestrial Biosphere Model by maximizing the benefit of the vegetation within the model. This corresponds to the evolutionary principle that vegetation has adapted to make best use of its local environment. We demonstrate this method with a simple coupled biosphere/soil hydrology model and find that deep rooted vegetation is predicted in most parts of the tropics. Even with a simple model like the one we use, it is possible to reproduce biome averages of observations fairly well. By using the optimized rooting depths global Annual Net Primary Production (and transpiration) increases substantially compared to a standard rooting depth of one meter, especially in tropical regions that have a dry season. The decreased river discharge due to the enhanced evaporation complies better with observations. We also found that the optimization process is primarily driven by the water deficit/surplus during the dry/wet season for humid and arid regions, respectively. Climate variability further enhances rooting depth estimates. In a sensitivity analysis where we simulate changes in the water use efficiency of the vegetation we find that vegetation with an optimized rooting depth is less vulnerable to variations in the forcing. We see the main application of this method in the modelling communities of land surface schemes of General Circulation Models and of global Terrestrial Biosphere Models. We conclude that in these models, the increased soil water storage is likely to have a significant impact on the simulated climate and the carbon budget, respectively. Also, effects of land use change like tropical deforestation are likely to be larger than previously thought.},

	Abstract = {Approximately one-third of the Earth's vegetative cover comprises savannas, grasslands, and other grass-dominated ecosystems. Paleobotanical, paleofaunal, and stable carbon isotope records suggest five major phases in the origin of grass-dominated ecosystems: (1) the late Maastrichtian (or Paleocene) origin of Poaceae; (2) the opening of Paleocene and Eocene forested environments in the early to middle Tertiary (3) an increase in the abundance of C(3) grasses during the middle Tertiary; (4) the origin of C(4) grasses in the middle Miocene: and (5) the spread of C(4) grass-dominated ecosystems at the expense of C(3) vegetation in the late Miocene. Grasses are known from all continents except Antarctica between the early Paleocene and middle Eocene. Herbivore morphology indicative of grazing, and therefore suggestive of grass-dominated ecosystems, appears in South America by the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, prior to the occurrence of grazing morphology elsewhere, and persists throughout the Cenozoic. Clear vertebrate and paleobotanical evidence of widespread grass-dominated ecosystems in northern continents does not occur until the early to middle Miocene. C(4) grasses are present from approximately 15 Ma and undergo a dramatic expansion in the lower latitudes of North America. South America, East Africa. and Pakistan between 9 and 4 Ma. The expansion may have taken place in a shorter interval in some regions. C(4) grasses are characteristic of seasonal, arid, and warm environments and are more tolerant of lower atmospheric CO(2) ({\textless} 400 ppmv) than C(3) plants. C(4) grass distribution, therefore, is climatically controlled. The late Miocene spread of C(4) grasses possibly involved a decrease in atmospheric CO(2) and heralded the establishment of modern seasonality and rainfall patterns.},

	Abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Understanding and accurately predicting the spatial patterns of habitat use by organisms is important for ecological research, biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management. However, this understanding is complicated by the effects of spatial scale, because the scale of analysis affects the quantification of species-environment relationships. 2. We therefore assessed the influence of environmental context (i.e. the characteristics of the landscape surrounding a site), varied over a large range of scales (i.e. ambit radii around focal sites), on the analysis and prediction of habitat selection by African elephants in Kruger National Park, South Africa. 3. We focused on the spatial scaling of the elephants' response to their main resources, forage and water, and found that the quantification of habitat selection strongly depended on the scales at which environmental context was considered. Moreover, the inclusion of environmental context at characteristic scales (i.e. those at which habitat selectivity was maximized) increased the predictive capacity of habitat suitability models. 4. The elephants responded to their environment in a scale-dependent and perhaps hierarchical manner, with forage characteristics driving habitat selection at coarse spatial scales, and surface water at fine spatial scales. 5. Furthermore, the elephants exhibited sexual habitat segregation, mainly in relation to vegetation characteristics. Male elephants preferred areas with high tree cover and low herbaceous biomass, whereas this pattern was reversed for female elephants. 6. We show that the spatial distribution of elephants can be better understood and predicted when scale-dependent species-environment relationships are explicitly considered. This demonstrates the importance of considering the influence of spatial scale on the analysis of spatial patterning in ecological phenomena.},

	Abstract = {Aim We present a continental-scale analysis that explores the processes controlling woody community structure in tropical savannas. We analyse how biotic and abiotic factors interact to promote and modify tree cover, examine alternative ecological hypotheses and quantify disturbance effects using satellite estimates of tree cover. Location African savannas. Methods Tree cover is represented as a resource-driven potential cover related to rainfall and soil characteristics perturbed by natural and human factors such as fire, cattle grazing, human population and cultivation. Within this framework our approach combines semi-empirical modelling and information theory to identify the best models. Results Woody community structure across African savannas is best represented by a sigmoidal response of tree cover to mean annual precipitation (MAP), with a dependency on soil texture, which is modified by the separate effects of fire, domestic livestock, human population density and cultivation intensity. This model explains c. 66\% of the variance in tree cover and appears consistent across the savanna regions of Africa. Main conclusions The analysis provides a new understanding of the importance and interaction of environmental and disturbance factors that create the broad spatial patterns of tree cover observed in African savannas. Woody cover increases with rainfall, but is modified by disturbances. These 'perturbation' effects depend on MAP regimes: in arid savannas (MAP {\textless} 400 mm) they are generally small ({\textless} 1\% decrease in cover), while in semi-arid and mesic savannas (400-1600 mm), perturbations result in an average 2\% (400 mm) to 23\% (1600 mm) decrease in cover; fire frequency and human population have more influence than cattle, and cultivation appears, on average, to lead to small increases in woody cover. Wet savannas (1600-2200 mm) are controlled by perturbations that inhibit canopy closure and reduce tree cover by, on average, 24-34\%. Full understanding of the processes determining savanna structure requires consideration of resource limitation and disturbance dynamics.},

	Abstract = {1. Plant--soil interactions play a central role in the biogeochemical carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and hydrological cycles. In the context of global environmental change, they are important both in modulating the impact of climate change and in regulating the feedback of greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, CH4 and N2O) to the climate system.2. Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) represent the most advanced tools available to predict the impacts of global change on terrestrial ecosystem functions and to examine their feedbacks to climate change. The accurate representation of plant--soil interactions in these models is crucial to improving predictions of the effects of climate change on a global scale.3. In this paper, we describe the general structure of DGVMs that use plant functional types (PFTs) classifications as a means to integrate plant--soil interactions and illustrate how models have been developed to improve the simulation of: (a) soil carbon dynamics, (b) nitrogen cycling, (c) drought impacts and (d) vegetation dynamics. For each of these, we discuss some recent advances and identify knowledge gaps.4. We identify three ongoing challenges, requiring collaboration between the global modelling community and process ecologists. First, the need for a critical evaluation of the representation of plant--soil processes in global models; second, the need to supply and integrate knowledge into global models; third, the testing of global model simulations against large-scale multifactor experiments and data from observatory gradients.5. Synthesis. This paper reviews how plant--soil interactions are represented in DGVMs that use PFTs and illustrates some model developments. We also identify areas of ecological understanding and experimentation needed to reduce uncertainty in future carbon coupled climate change predictions.},

@article{foley_incorporating_2000,
	Abstract = {Numerical models of Earth's climate system must consider the atmosphere and terrestrial biosphere as a coupled system, with biogeophysical and biogeochemical processes occurring across a range of timescales. On short timescales (i.e., seconds to hours), the coupled system is dominated by the rapid biophysical and biogeochemical processes that exchange energy, water, carbon dioxide, and momentum between the atmosphere and the land surface. Intermediate-timescale (i.e., days to months) processes include changes in the store of soil moisture, changes in carbon allocation, and vegetation phenology (e.g., budburst, leaf-out, senescence, dormancy). On longer timescales (i.e., seasons, years, and decades), there can be fundamental changes in the vegetation structure itself (disturbance, land use, stand growth). In order to consider the full range of coupled atmosphere-biosphere processes, we must extend climate models to include intermediate and long-term ecological phenomena. This paper reviews early attempts at linking climate and equilibrium vegetation models through iterative coupling techniques, and some important insights gained through this procedure. We then summarize recent developments in coupling global vegetation and climate models, and some of the applications of these tools to modeling climate change. Furthermore, we discuss more recent developments in vegetation models (including a new class of models called "dynamic global vegetation models"), and how these models are incorporated with atmospheric general circulation models. Fully coupled climate-vegetation models are still in the very early stages of development. Nevertheless, these prototype models have already indicated the importance of considering vegetation cover as an interactive part of the climate system.},

	Abstract = {Exposure to receptive female pheromone elicits guarding behavior in shore crab males (Carcinus maenas), but little is known about the effects of sex pheromone on male competition or if the female plays an active role in mate choice. This study examined whether female pheromone enhanced agonistic behavior between males and what effects visual and chemical cues had on the rules and costs of such contests. We also investigated whether females exhibit a preference for males in terms of size. Under laboratory conditions, solitary male shore crabs engaged males who already had possession of a female. The visual and chemical presence of a receptive female had an impact on contest rules and costs. Fights were costly in terms of duration and of sustaining injury with either one or both crabs incurring injury in 40\% of fights. To investigate the metabolic consequences of fighting over a perceived sexual resource (chemical cue only), fights were staged between pairs of size-matched males in the presence of water containing the female sex pheromone, water in which males had been kept, and untreated seawater. The duration and intensity of contests were greater when staged in the presence of the female pheromone compared with the two other treatments. Crabs that fought in the presence of female sex pheromone also had a greater accumulation of L-lactate and a reduction of glycogen stores. Fights were less costly in terms of injury with a single chemical cue compared with enhanced costs with a multiple sexual cue. The importance of female choice was determined by presenting postmolt females with different sized males. Males were kept in a fixed position, and the majority of females approached and performed courtship behavior to the largest males, demonstrating that females may be selective in terms of size.},

	Abstract = {Spatial extent can have two important consequences for population dynamics: It can generate spatial structure, in which individuals interact more intensely with neighbors than with more distant conspecifics, and it allows for environmental heterogeneity, in which habitat quality varies spatially. Studies of these features are difficult to interpret because the models are complex and sometimes idiosyncratic. Here we analyze one of the simplest possible spatial population models, to understand the mathematical basis for the observed patterns: two patches coupled by dispersal, with dynamics in each patch governed by the logistic map. With suitable choices of parameters, this model can represent spatial structure, environmental heterogeneity, or both in combination. We synthesize previous work and new analyses on this model, with two goals: to provide a comprehensive baseline to aid our understanding of more complex spatial models, and to generate predictions about the effects of spatial structure and environmental heterogeneity on population dynamics. Spatial structure alone can generate positive, negative, or zero spatial correlations between patches when dispersal rates are high, medium, or low relative to the complexity of the local dynamics. It can also lead to quasiperiodicity and hyperchaos, which are not present in the nonspatial model. With density-independent dispersal, spatial structure cannot destabilize equilibria or periodic orbits that would be stable in the absence of space. When densities in the two patches are uncorrelated, the probability that the population in a patch reaches extreme low densities is reduced relative to the same patch in isolation; this "rescue effect" would reduce the probability of metapopulation extinction beyond the simple effect of spreading of risk.},

Modelling approaches provide important tools for making future projections, but current models of the climate-biosphere interface remain overly simplistic, undermining the credibility of projections. We identify five ways in which substantial advances could be made in the next few years: (i) improving the accessibility and efficiency of biodiversity monitoring data, Oil quantifying the main determinants of the sensitivity of species to climate change, (Hi) incorporating community dynamics into projections of biodiversity responses, (iv) accounting for the influence of evolutionary processes on the response of species to climate change, and (v) improving the biophysical rule sets that define functional groupings of species in global models.},

@article{van_der_meeren_sex-_1994,
	Abstract = {1. The aim of this study was to characterize sex- and size-dependent mating tactics and their importance in a competitive mating system, where time and space are limited. A natural population of shore crabs Carcinus maenas L. was chosen for this purpose. Over 2 years, the population structure was investigated from May to September, which includes the 1-month-long mating season. Individual marks, lasting for several moults, were branded on 591 crabs. 2. Females, all roaming transients, were outnumbered by the males. Most receptive females entered a limited part of the study area just before moulting, creating a hot spot for the males, which congregated in the area weeks before the first females entered. The reason for choosing a mating ground is not clear, but the females should benefit from easy location of males. 3. Small males, predominant in the population, were rarely seen mating and, when mating, were always some distance from the hot spot. They roamed over large areas and were seldom resighted. Some medium-sized males showed very low mobility, staying site-fixed in or near the hot spot area from June to the end of the mating season. These males were the only polygynous males in that size group. Large males were mobile, but repeatedly seen mating in the hot spot. The largest males were often sequentially polygynous. The site-fixed males became roaming transients after the mating season. 4. Both site-fixation and roaming form part of a flexible mating tactic, based on mating possibilities concentrated in place and time. The choice of tactic was important for the individual male's mating success, especially in small and medium-sized males.},

@article{khatiwala_reconstruction_2009,
	Abstract = {The release of fossil fuel CO2 to the atmosphere by human activity has been implicated as the predominant cause of recent global climate change(1). The ocean plays a crucial role in mitigating the effects of this perturbation to the climate system, sequestering 20 to 35 per cent of anthropogenic CO2 emissions(2-4). Although much progress has been made in recent years in understanding and quantifying this sink, considerable uncertainties remain as to the distribution of anthropogenic CO2 in the ocean, its rate of uptake over the industrial era, and the relative roles of the ocean and terrestrial biosphere in anthropogenic CO2 sequestration. Here we address these questions by presenting an observationally based reconstruction of the spatially resolved, time-dependent history of anthropogenic carbon in the ocean over the industrial era. Our approach is based on the recognition that the transport of tracers in the ocean can be described by a Green's function, which we estimate from tracer data using a maximum entropy deconvolution technique. Our results indicate that ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 has increased sharply since the 1950s, with a small decline in the rate of increase in the last few decades. We estimate the inventory and uptake rate of anthropogenic CO2 in 2008 at 140 +/- 25 Pg C and 2.3 +/- 0.6 Pg C yr(-1), respectively. We find that the Southern Ocean is the primary conduit by which this CO2 enters the ocean (contributing over 40 per cent of the anthropogenic CO2 inventory in the ocean in 2008). Our results also suggest that the terrestrial biosphere was a source of CO2 until the 1940s, subsequently turning into a sink. Taken over the entire industrial period, and accounting for uncertainties, we estimate that the terrestrial biosphere has been anywhere from neutral to a net source of CO2, contributing up to half as muchCO(2) as has been taken up by the ocean over the same period.},

@article{tietjen_semi-arid_2007,
	Abstract = {Sustainable land use under climate change requires detailed knowledge of the system dynamics. This applies particularly for the management of domestic livestock in semi-arid and arid grazing systems, where the risk of degradation is high and likely climate change may have a strong impact. A suitable way to assess potential future trends of these complex systems is through the application of simulation models. We reviewed 41 models published between 1995 and 2005 simulating semi-arid and arid livestock grazing systems. The models were categorized according to the model aim and type, their temporal and spatial scale, and several indicators of model complexity. Additionally, we developed a list of model requirements for adequately simulating the effects of climate change. Based on these requirements, we evaluated the potential of current models to simulate impacts of climate change and determine important shortcomings. Three general model types could be distinguished, namely state and transition, difference and differential equation, and rule-based models. Over time, we found that the number of models aiming to improve management strategies increased, while there were fewer models that aimed to understand system dynamics. This was accompanied by a trend to simplify model descriptions of hydrological relationships. Important shortcomings of current models included the impact of increased CO2 levels on plant productivity and the ability to resolve changes in intra-annual precipitation patterns. The consideration of both external drivers is crucial under climate change, hence sustainable long-term decision making is currently lacking important information. Synthesis and applications. Sustainable livestock management in semi-arid and arid systems requires knowledge about effects of future climate change to adjust livestock density adequately. Producers' experiences from current weather conditions are not necessarily transferable to future conditions, thus models could help to support management. However, an analysis of current models has shown that few existing models are able to assess the impacts of the predicted climate change. Therefore, we call for the development of new dynamic grazing models that provide land managers with the necessary tools to face the threat of future climate changes.},

@article{metselaar_shape_2007,
	Abstract = {Assuming transpiration to be reduced after a critical pressure head (usually chosen as −1.5 MPa or −150 m) at the root surface has been reached, transpiration rates in this so-called falling-rate phase were analyzed numerically for soils described by the van Genuchten--Mualem equations (numerical soils). The analysis was based on the differential equation describing radial flow to a single root. Numerically, the system was simulated by an implicit scheme. It is shown that, at limiting hydraulic conditions, relative transpiration (ratio between actual and potential transpiration) is equal to relative matric flux potential (ratio between actual matric flux potential and matric flux potential at the onset of limiting hydraulic conditions). Given this equality, transpiration reduction functions as a function of soil water content and as a function of time are presented for five types of analytical soils: a constant diffusivity, Green and Ampt, Brooks and Corey, versatile nonlinear, and exponential soil. While in the case of constant diffusivity, relative transpiration decreases as a linear function of water content, for the remaining four cases the decrease is a concave function of soil water content. Numerical simulations also result in a concave shape, unless the difference between water content at the onset of limiting hydraulic conditions and at permanent wilting is very small, for example, at high root densities. These discrepancies may be explained by the relative importance of a transition period between the constant- and falling-rate phases.},

Using simple physical principles and empirically derived relationships, SERA provides an analytical venue to test alternative hypotheses about individual functional traits governing ecological or evolutionary processes at the population or community level of complexity. Our analyses show that, as a result of competition for light and space, individual-level features scale up to produce species ensemble properties such as the scaling of self-thinning, size-dependent mortality, realistic size-frequency distributions, and a broad spectrum of empirically observed relationships for the species examined. SERA also predicts the competitive exclusion of conifers by angiosperms and the age at which reproductive maturity is achieved by different species. SERA serves as a null hypothesis by demonstrating that biologically complex phenomena, including widely observed scaling relationships at the species-ensemble level, can emerge from the operation of simple and transparent "rules" governing competition for space and light.},

@article{malhi_linkages_2015,
	Abstract = {Understanding the relationship between photosynthesis, net primary productivity and growth in forest ecosystems is key to understanding how these ecosystems will respond to global anthropogenic change, yet the linkages among these components are rarely explored in detail. We provide the first comprehensive description of the productivity, respiration and carbon allocation of contrasting lowland Amazonian forests spanning gradients in seasonal water deficit and soil fertility. Using the largest dataset assembled to date, ten sites in three countries all studied with a standardized methodology, we find that (i) gross primary productivity (GPP) has a simple relationship with seasonal water deficit, but that (ii) site-to-site variations in GPP have little power in explaining site-to-site spatial variations in net primary productivity (NPP) or growth because of concomitant changes in carbon use efficiency (CUE), and conversely, the woody growth rate of a tropical forest is a very poor proxy for its productivity. Instead, (iii) spatial patterns of biomass are much more driven by patterns of residence times (i.e. tree mortality rates) than by spatial variation in productivity or tree growth. Current theory and models of tropical forest carbon cycling under projected scenarios of global atmospheric change can benefit from advancing beyond a focus on GPP. By improving our understanding of poorly understood processes such as CUE, NPP allocation and biomass turnover times, we can provide more complete and mechanistic approaches to linking climate and tropical forest carbon cycling.

@article{mccormack_redefining_2015,
	Abstract = {Fine roots acquire essential soil resources and mediate biogeochemical cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. Estimates of carbon and nutrient allocation to build and maintain these structures remain uncertain because of the challenges of consistently measuring and interpreting fine-root systems. Traditionally, fine roots have been defined as all roots ≤ 2 mm in diameter, yet it is now recognized that this approach fails to capture the diversity of form and function observed among fine-root orders. Here, we demonstrate how order-based and functional classification frameworks improve our understanding of dynamic root processes in ecosystems dominated by perennial plants. In these frameworks, fine roots are either separated into individual root orders or functionally defined into a shorter-lived absorptive pool and a longer-lived transport fine-root pool. Using these frameworks, we estimate that fine-root production and turnover represent 22\% of terrestrial net primary production globally -- a c. 30\% reduction from previous estimates assuming a single fine-root pool. Future work developing tools to rapidly differentiate functional fine-root classes, explicit incorporation of mycorrhizal fungi into fine-root studies, and wider adoption of a two-pool approach to model fine roots provide opportunities to better understand below-ground processes in the terrestrial biosphere.},

In this review, we show two major problems with the implicitly assumed straightforward cause-effect relationship. Firstly, several studies suggest that vegetation itself may have considerable effects on regional climate implying a positive feedback, which can potentially lead to large-scale hysteresis. Secondly, vegetation ecologists have found that effects of plants on microclimate and soils can cause a microscale positive feedback, implying that critical precipitation conditions for colonization of a site may differ from those for disappearance from that site. We argue that it is important to integrate these nonlinearities at disparate scales in models to produce more realistic predictions of potential effects of climate change and deforestation.},

	Abstract = {The low temperature limits to germination (T-b) and carbohydrate composition have been investigated in seeds of two sub-tropical rainforest tree species, Erythrina caffra (with orthodox viability characteristics) and Guilfoylia monostylis (with recalcitrant viability characteristics). Sub-populations of E caffra seeds demonstrated a requirement for a common base temperature (8.5degreesC), contrasting those of G. monostylis that required different base temperatures (6-10degreesC). Chilling (at 6-7degreesC) of rehydrated dry seeds of E, caffra induced chilling stress (loss of germinability) within 8 hours, unlike seeds of G. monostylis and physiologically mature (but without maturation drying) seeds of E, caffra which tolerated chilling for several weeks. At physiological maturity, seeds of G. monostylis displayed more constituent sugars than those of E. caffra. Maturation drying in seeds of E. caffra was associated with a sharp increase (about 200 \% or higher) in starch, disaccharide and oligosaccharide contents. This increase was coincident with a marked decline (over 90 \%) or loss of monosaccharides. There was a reduction (generally less than 50 \%) in the content of all sugars at maturity in seeds of G. monostylis. In seeds of both species, the time of highest inositol concentration was at physiological maturity when moisture content was about 60-65 \% (fresh weight basis). Alpha-amyloloc activity was extremely low or absent during seed development in E caffra, unlike G. monostylls that had relatively high alpha-amylolytic activity and monosaccharides content. Seeds of both species exhibited similar sucrose and monosaccharide patterns during germination sensu stricto (when levels decreased) and following radicle emergence (when levels increased). The nature and content of sugars in seeds of these species at physiological maturity might be associated with protection against the effects of chilling. Also, different di-/oligosaccharide accumulation patterns shown by seeds of both species with desiccation appeared consistent with the need for specific protective sugars within seed tissues to ensure desiccation tolerance.},

	Abstract = {A simple, flexible, pantropical forest classification framework is proposed to provide a common platform for foresters, vegetation mappers, climatic modellers, biogeographers and plant ecologists. The framework is provided by bioclimatic types, defined on annual rainfall, seasonality and mean temperature of the coldest month. Within each bioclimatic type a series of forest formations occurs, defined on forest structure and physiognomy. The formations are pantropical. The main schemes of forest classification published for continental Asia, the Malay Archipelago, America and Africa are given in Tables 1-4, set against this bioclimatic framework. Different authors have used different names for forest formations and is unlikely to ever be general agreement on nomenclature. Floristic composition varies across continents and regions. For some purposes it is useful to divide bioclimatic types into ecofloristic zones. The correspondences given in this paper are between bioclimates and forest formations in the absence of anthropic impacts. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Fires play an important role in determining the composition and structure of vegetation in semiarid ecosystems. The study of the interactions between fire and vegetation requires a stochastic approach because of the random and unpredictable nature of fire occurrences. To this end, this article develops a minimalist probabilistic framework to investigate the impact of intermittent fire occurrences on the temporal dynamics of vegetation. This framework is used to analyze the emergence of statistically stable conditions favorable to tree- grass coexistence in savannas. It is found that these conditions can be induced and stabilized by the stochastic fire regime. A decrease in fire frequency leads to bush encroachment, while more frequent and intense fires favor savanna- to- grassland conversions. The positive feedback between fires and vegetation can convert states of tree- grass coexistence in semiarid savannas into bistable conditions, with both woodland and grassland as possible, though mutually exclusive, stable states of the system.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the interplay between climate and land-use dynamics is a fundamental concern for assessing the vulnerability of Amazonia to climate change. In this study, we analyse satellite-derived monthly and annual time series of rainfall, fires and deforestation to explicitly quantify the seasonal patterns and relationships between these three variables, with a particular focus on the Amazonian drought of 2005. Our results demonstrate a marked seasonality with one peak per year for all variables analysed, except deforestation. For the annual cycle, we found correlations above 90\% with a time lag between variables. Deforestation and fires reach the highest values three and six months, respectively, after the peak of the rainy season. The cumulative number of hot pixels was linearly related to the size of the area deforested annually from 1998 to 2004 (r2=0.84, p=0.004). During the 2005 drought, the number of hot pixels increased 43\% in relation to the expected value for a similar deforested area (approx. 19 000 km2). We demonstrated that anthropogenic forcing, such as land-use change, is decisive in determining the seasonality and annual patterns of fire occurrence. Moreover, droughts can significantly increase the number of fires in the region even with decreased deforestation rates. We may expect that the ongoing deforestation, currently based on slash and burn procedures, and the use of fires for land management in Amazonia will intensify the impact of droughts associated with natural climate variability or human-induced climate change and, therefore, a large area of forest edge will be under increased risk of fires.},

(2011; RS1) and Baccini et al. (2012; RS2). Mitchard et al. concluded that both the earlier remote-sensing based maps were incorrect because they did not conform to Mitchard et al. interpretation of the field-based results. In making their case, however, they misrepresented the fundamental nature of primary field and remote-sensing data and committed critical errors in their assumptions about the accuracy of research plots, the interpolation methodology and the statistical analysis. By ignoring the large uncertainty associated with ground estimates of biomass and the significant under-sampling and spatial bias of research plots, Mitchard et al. reported erroneous trends and artificial patterns of biomass over Amazonia. Because of these misrepresentations and methodological flaws, we find their critique of the satellite-derived maps to be invalid.},

	Abstract = {Geological research has illustrated the transition of palaeoenvironmental patterns by the earliest Miocene from a planetary-wind-dominant type to a monsoon-dominant type, indicating that the East Asian monsoon became markedly intensified and played a leading role in the East Asian climate. From a modeling point of view, the pioneering research using the reduced number of scenarios had demonstrated that both the Tibetan Plateau uplift and the Paratethys Sea retreat were important for understanding the Asian monsoon evolution. However, the sensitivity of the Paratethys retreat to the East Asian climate still needs further studies based on the more detailed scenarios. Thirty numerical experiments under the six Paratethys Sea and the five Tibetan Plateau conditions illustrate the shifts from zonal climate to the monsoon climate in East Asia. The results confirm again that both the Paratethys retreat and the Tibetan plateau uplift play important roles in the formation of the monsoon-dominant environmental pattern, and show that the Paratethys retreat can strengthen the East Asian monsoon and greatly increase humidity and aridity respectively in the monsoon areas and Northwest China, which is similar to the impact of the Tibetan Plateau uplift on the East Asian climate. Furthermore, the fact that the Paratethys Sea retreats to the Turan Plate is found to be the key criterion for the palaeoenvironmental patterns' transition in China. The shrinkage of Paratethys Sea leads to the reconstructions of the pressure system and the atmospheric circulations, which result in the variations of precipitation and the transition of palaeoenvironmental patterns.

@article{saatchi_distribution_2007,
	Abstract = {The amount and spatial distribution of forest biomass in the Amazon basin is a major source of uncertainty in estimating the flux of carbon released from land-cover and land-use change. Direct measurements of aboveground live biomass (AGLB) are limited to small areas of forest inventory plots and site-specific allometric equations that cannot be readily generalized for the entire basin. Furthermore, there is no spaceborne remote sensing instrument that can measure tropical forest biomass directly. To determine the spatial distribution of forest biomass of the Amazon basin, we report a method based on remote sensing metrics representing various forest structural parameters and environmental variables, and more than 500 plot measurements of forest biomass distributed over the basin. A decision tree approach was used to develop the spatial distribution of AGLB for seven distinct biomass classes of lowland old-growth forests with more than 80\% accuracy. AGLB for other vegetation types, such as the woody and herbaceous savanna and secondary forests, was directly estimated with a regression based on satellite data. Results show that AGLB is highest in Central Amazonia and in regions to the east and north, including the Guyanas. Biomass is generally above 300 Mg ha−1 here except in areas of intense logging or open floodplains. In Western Amazonia, from the lowlands of Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia to the Andean mountains, biomass ranges from 150 to 300 Mg ha−1. Most transitional and seasonal forests at the southern and northwestern edges of the basin have biomass ranging from 100 to 200 Mg ha−1. The AGLB distribution has a significant correlation with the length of the dry season. We estimate that the total carbon in forest biomass of the Amazon basin, including the dead and belowground biomass, is 86 Pg C with $\pm$20\% uncertainty.},

	Abstract = {Leaf demography and growth of six common, co-occurring woody plant species that varied in stature (tree vs. shrub) and leaf texture (sclerophyllous, coriaceous, malacophyllous) were examined in a subtropical savanna parkland in southern Texas, USA. We tested the hypotheses that, (a) leaves of plants with evergreen canopies would have longer life spans than those of deciduous species; (b) supplementation of soil moisture would decrease leaf life span in both evergreen and deciduous species; (c) species responses to increased soil moisture availability would be inversely related to leaf longevity; and (d) deciduous growth forms would exhibit a greater growth response to increased soil moisture availability than their evergreen counterparts. A variety of seasonal leaf habits (evergreen, winter-deciduous and summer-deciduous canopies) and leaf life spans (median = 66 to 283 days) were represented by the targeted species, but there was no clear relationship between seasonal leaf habit and leaf longevity. Among species with evergreen canopies, median leaf longevity ranged from short (Zanthoxylum fagara = 116 days; Condalia hookeri = 158 days) to long (Berberis trifoliolata = 283 days) but did not exceed 1 yr. In fact, leaf longevity in evergreen shrubs was often comparable to, or shorter than, that of species with deciduous canopies (Ziziphus obtusifolia = 66 days; Diospyros texana = 119 days; Prosopis glandulosa = 207 days). Augmentation of surface soil moisture had no detectable effect on median leaf life span in any species and there was no clear relationship between leaf longevity and species growth responses to irrigation. Contrary to expectations, species with evergreen canopies responded to irrigation by producing more leaf biomass, longer shoots and more leaf cohorts/year than did deciduous species. Species differences in the annual cycle of leaf initiation, leaf longevity and canopy development, combined with contrasts in root distributions and a highly variable climate, may allow for spatial and temporal partitioning of resources and hence, woody species coexistence and diversity in this system. However, the lack of expected relationships between leaf longevity, leaf habit and plant responses to resource enhancement suggests that structure-function relationships and functional groupings developed in strongly seasonal environments cannot be applied with confidence to these subtropical savannas and thorn woodlands.},

@article{davidson_soil_1998,
	Abstract = {Variation in soil temperature can account for most of the seasonal and diel variation in soil CO2 efflux, but the temperature effect is not always consistent, and other factors such as soil water content are known to influence soil respiration. The objectives of this research were to study the spatial and temporal variation in soil respiration in a temperate forested landscape and to evaluate temperature and soil water functions as predictors of soil respiration. Soil CO2 fluxes were measured with chambers throughout an annual cycle in six study areas at the Harvard Forest in central Massachusetts that include soil drainage classes from well drained to very poorly drained. The mean annual estimate of soil CO2 efflux was 7.2 Mg ha--1, but ranged from 5.3 in the swamp site to 8.5 in a well-drained site, indicating that landscape heterogeneity is related to soil drainage class. An exponential function relating CO2 fluxes to soil temperature accounted for 80\% of the seasonal variation in fluxes across all sites (Q10 = 3.9), but the Q10 ranged from 3.4 to 5.6 for the individual study sites. A significant drought in 1995 caused rapid declines in soil respiration rates in August and September in five of the six sites (a swamp site was the exception). This decline in CO2 fluxes correlated exponentially with decreasing soil matric potential, indicating a mechanistic effect of drought stress. At moderate to high water contents, however, soil water content was negatively correlated with soil temperature, which precluded distinguishing between the effects of these two confounded factors on CO2 flux. Occurrence of high Q10 values and variation in Q10 values among sites may be related to: (i) confounding effects of high soil water content; (ii) seasonal and diel patterns in root respiration and turnover of fine roots that are linked to above ground phenology and metabolism; and (iii) variation in the depth where CO2 is produced. The Q10 function can yield reasonably good predictions of annual fluxes of CO2, but it is a simplification that masks responses of root and microbial processes to variation in temperature and water content throughout the soil.},

	Abstract = {The abstraction of ground water by vegetation and its influence on the behaviour of geotechnical structures such as pavements, foundations and slopes has been researched for many years. In recent years, the use of numerical methods in geotechnical engineering has rapidly increased. A major challenge for numerical modelers involves the specification of the surface flow boundary condition to model root water uptake by vegetation. The abstraction of ground water by roots is a complex process which involves the interaction of the atmosphere, vegetation and the ground. Accurate prediction of the pore water pressure changes induced by vegetation requires the development of algorithms which can mimic the process of transpiration by vegetation in the continuity equation of fluid flow. This paper presents a root water uptake model which has been coded into a finite element program that can perform coupled (mechanical and fluid flow behaviour) analyses. The input data includes rainfall, potential evapotranspiration and maximum root depth. The key features of the model are discussed first, followed by a presentation of results from a series of parametric studies.},

	Abstract = {Empirical evidence for large-scale abrupt changes in ecosystems such as lakes and vegetation of semi-arid regions is growing. Such changes, called regime shifts, can lead to degradation of ecological services. We study simple ecological models that show a catastrophic transition as a control parameter is varied and propose a novel early warning signal that exploits two ubiquitous features of ecological systems: nonlinearity and large external fluctuations. Either reduced resilience or increased external fluctuations can tip ecosystems to an alternative stable state. It is shown that changes in asymmetry in the distribution of time series data, quantified by changing skewness, is a model-independent and reliable early warning signal for both routes to regime shifts. Furthermore, using model simulations that mimic field measurements and a simple analysis of real data from abrupt climate change in the Sahara, we study the feasibility of skewness calculations using data available from routine monitoring.},

@article{nunez_connectivity_2013,
	Abstract = {As the climate changes, human land use may impede species from tracking areas with suitable climates. Maintaining connectivity between areas of different temperatures could allow organisms to move along temperature gradients and allow species to continue to occupy the same temperature space as the climate warms. We used a coarse-filter approach to identify broad corridors for movement between areas where human influence is low while simultaneously routing the corridors along present-day spatial gradients of temperature. We modified a cost--distance algorithm to model these corridors and tested the model with data on current land-use and climate patterns in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. The resulting maps identified a network of patches and corridors across which species may move as climates change. The corridors are likely to be robust to uncertainty in the magnitude and direction of future climate change because they are derived from gradients and land-use patterns. The assumptions we applied in our model simplified the stability of temperature gradients and species responses to climate change and land use, but the model is flexible enough to be tailored to specific regions by incorporating other climate variables or movement costs. When used at appropriate resolutions, our approach may be of value to local, regional, and continental conservation initiatives seeking to promote species movements in a changing climate.

@article{king_linking_2005,
	Abstract = {The influence of stem allometry on tree growth is explored with a simple model which projects growth for the idealized case where crown proportions, leaf properties and light use efficiency are held constant throughout growth. Here, the tree is regarded as a machine that grows itself by using light energy to synthesize biomass, which is in turn partitioned among its parts so as to maintain a specified allometry. The following model variants were considered. (1) The base case, which approximates a forest-grown tree, shows that the requirement that basal trunk diameter D-b proportional to H-1.5 (where H is total tree height), to prevent buckling, substantially slows the height growth rate with increasing tree size, as is observed in real trees. (2) The isometric tree, which maintains geometric similarity, such that D-b proportional to H, has a nearly constant height growth rate, attaining 40 m in 1/3 of the time required for the more realistic, base case tree. (3) The "seedling tree", which maintains constant leaf/stem mass (that of a seedling), requiring that D-b proportional to H-0.5, grows exponentially throughout life, attaining 40 m in 1/20 of the time required for the base case. (4) The "leech tree", which reconfigures its branches, leaves and roots as it grows, rather than turning over these parts, shows that such replacement costs substantially slow growth and reduce shade tolerance. These results demonstrate the strong links between allometry and growth and suggest that differences in support costs are an important cause of observed interspecific differences in height growth rate.

	Abstract = {In this review, we propose a new framework, dynamic disequilibrium of the carbon cycles, to assess future land carbon-sink dynamics. The framework recognizes internal ecosystem processes that drive the carbon cycle toward equilibrium, such as donor pool-dominated transfer; and external forces that create disequilibrium, such as disturbances and global change. Dynamic disequilibrium within one disturbance-recovery episode causes temporal changes in the carbon source and sink at yearly and decadal scales, but has no impacts on longer-term carbon sequestration unless disturbance regimes shift. Such shifts can result in long-term regional carbon loss or gain and be quantified by stochastic statistics for use in prognostic modeling. If the regime shifts result in ecosystem state changes in regions with large carbon reserves at risk, the global carbon cycle might be destabilized.},

@article{adams_analysis_2004,
	Abstract = {We inter-compare the mathematical formulation of ten models of terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP) and their functional responses to temperature (T), carbon dioxide (CO2), Soil water (W) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The models span a broad spectrum of complexity of approaches from the original, empirical Miami model, through beta-factor, and global-average box models, to the dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) TRIFFID and BIOME3. Five of the models separate photosynthesis and respiration, although only three directly consider biochemistry. Equations for all the models are given in a complete, compact, standardized format. NPP responses to temperature differ markedly: beta-factor models show only a tiny increase with temperature, empirical models predict a modest S-shaped response saturating above 35 degreesC (a surrogate for drought effects), biochemical and quasi-biochemical models show a peaked response with an optimum in the range 15-25 degreesC except for DEMETER ({\textless} 10 degreesC). Qualitative differences in whether respiration exhibits a peaked or exponential response to temperature have only a modest effect on NPP. The CO2 response of NPP is qualitatively similar in all but one model that misrepresents it. Where a water stress response of NPP is represented, it is saturating in all but the same model, where NPP declines under high soil moisture. Where represented, the PAR response of NPP is saturating, but the saturation point differs considerably. When responses to two environmental variables are combined, the second variable typically just scales the response to the first. In biochemical models, the temperature optimum of NPP increases with CO2, and it also increases noticeably with PAR in TRIFFID and a derivative of it. Where different plant functional types (PFTs) are represented, C-4 grasses have the greatest maximum NPP at a higher optimum temperature than any C-3 PFT. Boreal, needle-leaf trees generally have the lowest NPR Additional uncertainties in modelling respiration, stomatal conductance, light-use efficiency, and scaling to the canopy level are discussed. We suggest that a concerted effort to standardize definitions, notation, units and PFTs would add a degree of transparency that is currently lacking in NPP modelling. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

@article{storch_universal_2012,
	Abstract = {Despite the broad conceptual and applied relevance of how the number of species or endemics changes with area (the species-area and endemics-area relationships (SAR and EAR)), our understanding of universality and pervasiveness of these patterns across taxa and regions has remained limited. The SAR has traditionally been approximated by a power law(1), but recent theories predict a triphasic SAR in logarithmic space, characterized by steeper increases in species richness at both small and large spatial scales(2-6). Here we uncover such universally upward accelerating SARs for amphibians, birds and mammals across the world's major landmasses. Although apparently taxon-specific and continent-specific, all curves collapse into one universal function after the area is rescaled by using the mean range sizes of taxa within continents. In addition, all EARs approximately follow a power law with a slope close to 1, indicating that for most spatial scales there is roughly proportional species extinction with area loss. These patterns can be predicted by a simulation model based on the random placement of contiguous ranges within a domain. The universality of SARs and EARs after rescaling implies that both total and endemic species richness within an area, and also their rate of change with area, can be estimated by using only the knowledge of mean geographic range size in the region and mean species richness at one spatial scale.},

* *We categorized vegetation on all continents as `savanna' (open habitats with a C4 grass layer) or `not-savanna' (closed habitats with no C4 grass layer) and used a combination of statistical approaches to examine how the presence of savanna varied as a function of five environmental correlates.

@article{alton_radiative_2005,
	Abstract = {We have expanded the Monte Carlo, ray-tracing model FLIGHT in order to simulate photosynthesis within three-dimensional, heterogeneous tree canopies. In contrast to the simple radiative transfer schemes adopted in many land-surface models (e.g., the Big Leaf approximation), our simulation calculates explicitly the leaf irradiance at different heights within the canopy and thus produces an accurate scale-up in photosynthesis from leaf to canopy level. We also account for both diffuse and direct sunlight. For a Siberian stand of Scots pine Pinus sylvestris, FLIGHT predicts observed carbon assimilation, across the full range of sky radiance, with an r.m.s. error of 12\%. Our main findings for this sparse canopy, using both measurements and model, are as follows: (1) Observationally, we detect a light-use efficiency (LUE) increase of only ≤10\% for the canopy when the proportion of diffuse sky radiance is 75\% rather than 25\%. The corresponding enhancement predicted by our simulations is 10--20\%. With such small increases in LUE, our site will not assimilate more carbon on overcast days compared to seasonally equivalent sunny days; (2) the scale-up in photosynthesis from top-leaf to canopy is less than unity. The Big Leaf approximation, based on Beer's law and light-acclimated leaf nitrogen, overpredicts this scale-up by ≥60\% for low sky radiance (≤500 μmolPAR m−2 s−1); (3) when leaf nitrogen is distributed so as to maximize canopy photosynthesis, the increase in the canopy carbon assimilation, compared with a uniform nitrogen distribution, is small (\${\textbackslash}simeq\$4\%). Maximum assimilation occurs when the vertical gradient of leaf nitrogen is slightly shallower than that of the light profile.},

@article{murdoch_population_1994,
	Abstract = {Population regulation is a fundamental process related to most phenomena in ecology, including evolutionary ecology. I review the conceptual basis for defining regulation as bounded fluctuations in abundance, in contrast to the unbounded fluctuations of random-walk populations. Regulation arises as a result of potentially stabilizing density-dependent processes, even when brought about by ''non-equilibrium'' mechanisms. Although the phenomenon is unambiguous in theory, detecting regulation by finding evidence for density dependence in a series of population estimates faces unsolved statistical problems. So, while there is growing evidence for widespread regulation, severe detection problems remain. I illustrate these with data from bird populations. Whether regulation is typically achieved by local stabilizing mechanisms or via metapopulation dynamics remains to be determined. I summarize recent studies on a particularly well-regulated system-red scale (Aonidiella aurantii) and its controlling parasitoid, Aphytis melinus. We tested and failed to find evidence for eight hypotheses that might account for the system's stability, including spatial heterogeneity in attack rates, a refuge, and metapopulation dynamics. We also failed to find evidence for density-dependent parasitism. but such density dependence might be still be present. Recent laboratory and modeling studies have uncovered a number of other potentially stabilizing mechanisms centering on the response of individual Aphytis to their size-structured host. This plethora of size- and stage-dependent interactions leads naturally to a consideration of the factors controlling Aphytis' size-dependent behavioral decisions, and consequently to the elaboration of size-structured models. The latter provide a vehicle for bringing together investigations of selection of life histories, and population dynamics. This is illustrated by a model of Aphytis and red scale dynamics that can explain a dramatic case of competitive displacement. The red scale/Aphytis system exemplifies a particularly challenging problem in population regulation, namely to account for the co-occurrence of stability and severe suppression of the prey population. A potentially generic solution is to assume stabilizing density dependence in the parasitoid or predator population; however, this has the consequence of increasing the host or prey population equilibrium. My colleagues and I have shown that observed prey densities in a plankton system are too low for such a mechanism to be operating. Further work is needed to test this and other hypotheses.},

	Abstract = {Seedling relative growth rate (RGR) achieved under favourable growth conditions can be thought of as a useful bioassay of the potential ability of species to take advantage of favourable growth opportunities; that is, of a species' growth strategy. The consistency of relationships between RGR and its component attributes leaf nitrogen productivity (LNP), leaf N per area (LNCa), specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf mass ratio (LMR) was assessed across 12 datasets comprising three growth forms (grasses, herbaceous dicots and woody plants; 250 species in total). These relationships were characterised in terms of scaling slopes (regressions on log-log axes, the slopes giving the proportional relationship between the variables). Mathematically, the expected scaling slope between RGR and each component is 1.0, giving an appropriate null hypothesis to test against (whereas the widely used null hypothesis of zero correlation is in fact inappropriate for this situation). Deviations below 1:1 scaling slopes indicate negative covariance between the components. Consequently, the correlation structure between the components of RGR should also be investigated. Biologically, RGR should scale 1:1 with SLA at a given LNCa and somewhat more weakly with LNCa at a given SLA. SLA and LNCa should themselves scale with a slope of between 0 and -1, with the actual slope indicating the extent to which between-species variation in SLA dilutes leaf N on an area basis versus the ability of species to maintain LNCa at a given growth irradiance. On average, across the 12 datasets RGR scaled close-to-proportionally with SLA, and 1:1 with SLA at a given LNCa. RGR scaled with LNCa with null or negative slopes, since SLA and LNCa scaled negatively (with slopes generally shallower than -1); however, RGR scaled positively (but less than proportionally) with LNCa at a given SLA. For these key relationships there were no qualitatively different conclusions with respect to the growth form under consideration or the growth irradiance at which the seedlings were grown. RGR also scaled close-to-proportionally with LNP, while LNP and LNCa were negatively associated. These relationships involving LNP are difficult to interpret since it can be shown that they are, at least potentially, the result of the interactions between RGR, SLA and LNCa, as well as reflecting intrinsic differences in the efficiency of nitrogen use in the growth process.},

The African Humid Period has been attributed to a strengthening of the African monsoon due to gradual orbital increases in summer season insolation. However, the onset and termination of this humid period were very abrupt, occurring within decades to centuries. Both transitions occurred when summer season insolation crossed a nearly identical threshold value, which was 4.2\% greater than present. These abrupt climate responses to gradual insolation forcing require strongly non-linear feedback processes, and current coupled climate model studies invoke vegetation and ocean temperature feedbacks as candidate mechanisms for the non-linear climate sensitivity. The African monsoon climate system is thus a low-latitude corollary to the bi-stable behavior of high-latitude deep ocean thermohaline circulation, which is similarly capable of rapid and large-amplitude climate transitions.

	Abstract = {Forest soils store a substantial amount of carbon, often more than the forest vegetation does. Estimates of the amount of soil carbon, and in particular estimates of changes in these amounts are still inaccurate. Measuring soil carbon is laborious, and measurements taken at a few statistically unrepresentative sites are difficult to scale to larger areas. We combined a simple dynamic model of soil carbon with litter production estimated on the basis of stand parameters, models of tree allometry and biomass turnover rates of different biomass components. This integrated method was used to simulate soil carbon as forest stands develop. The results were compared with measurements of soil carbon from 64 forest sites in southern Finland. Measured carbon stocks in the organic soil layer increased by an average of 4.7+/-1.4 g m(-2) a(-1) with increasing stand age and no significant changes were measured in the amount of carbon in mineral soil. Our integrated method indicated that soil carbon stocks declined to a minimum 20 years after clear-cutting and the subsequent increase in the soil carbon stock (F/H - 1 m) was 5.8+/-1.0 g m(-2) a(-1) averaged over the period to next harvesting (similar to125 years). Simulated soil carbon accumulation slowed down considerably in stands older than 50 years. The carbon stock measured (F/H - 1 m) for the study area averaged 6.8+/-2.5 kg m(-2). The simulated carbon stock in soil was 7.0+/-0.6 kg m(-2) on average. These tests of the validity of the integrated model suggest that this method is suitable for estimating the amount of carbon in soil and its changes on regional scales.},

	Abstract = {Evidence is mounting that extinctions are altering key processes important to the productivity and sustainability of Earth's ecosystems(1-4). Further species loss will accelerate change in ecosystem processes(5-8), but it is unclear how these effects compare to the direct effects of other forms of environmental change that are both driving diversity loss and altering ecosystem function. Here we use a suite of meta-analyses of published data to show that the effects of species loss on productivity and decomposition-two processes important in all ecosystems-are of comparable magnitude to the effects of many other global environmental changes. In experiments, intermediate levels of species loss (21-40\%) reduced plant production by 5-10\%, comparable to previously documented effects of ultraviolet radiation and climate warming. Higher levels of extinction (41-60\%) had effects rivalling those of ozone, acidification, elevated CO2 and nutrient pollution. At intermediate levels, species loss generally had equal or greater effects on decomposition than did elevated CO2 and nitrogen addition. The identity of species lost also had a large effect on changes in productivity and decomposition, generating a wide range of plausible outcomes for extinction. Despite the need for more studies on interactive effects of diversity loss and environmental changes, our analyses clearly show that the ecosystem consequences of local species loss are as quantitatively significant as the direct effects of several global change stressors that have mobilized major international concern and remediation efforts(9).},

	Abstract = {Functional convergence in hydraulic architecture and water relations, and potential trade-offs in resource allocation were investigated in six dominant neotropical savanna tree species from central Brazil during the peak of the dry season. Common relationships between wood density and several aspects of plant water relations and hydraulic architecture were observed. All species and individuals shared the same negative exponential relationship between sapwood saturated water content and wood density. Wood density was a good predictor of minimum (midday) leaf water potential and total daily transpiration, both of which decreased linearly with increasing wood density for all individuals and species. With respect to hydraulic architecture, specific and leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity decreased and the leaf:sapwood area ratio increased more than 5-fold as wood density increased from 0.37 to 0.71 g cm−3 for all individuals and species. Wood density was also a good predictor of the temporal dynamics of water flow in stems, with the time of onset of sap flow in the morning and the maximum sap flow tending to occur progressively earlier in the day as wood density increased. Leaf properties associated with wood density included stomatal conductance, specific leaf area, and osmotic potential at the turgor loss point, which decreased linearly with increasing wood density. Wood density increased linearly with decreasing bulk soil water potential experienced by individual plants during the dry season, suggesting that wood density was greatest in individuals with mostly shallow roots, and therefore limited access to more abundant soil water at greater depths. Despite their taxonomic diversity and large intrapopulation differences in architectural traits, the six co-occurring species and their individuals shared similar functional relationships between all pairs of variables studied. Thus, rather than differing intrinsically in physiological responsiveness, the species and the individuals appeared to have distinct operating ranges along common physiological response curves dictated by plant architectural and structural features. The patterns of water uptake and access to soil water during the dry season appeared to be the main determinant of wood density, which constrained evolutionary options related to plant water economy and hydraulic architecture, leading to functional convergence in the neotropical savanna trees studied.},

They were measured directly with the eddy covariance technique over a 6-year period that spanned between July 2001 and June 2007 and experienced a large range in precipitation ( 376 mm to 888 mm). Despite a two-fold range in precipitation, annual E ranged much less, between 266 mm and 391 mm. We found that pronounced energy-limited and water-limited periods occurred within the same year. In the water-limited period, monthly integrated E scaled negatively with solar radiation and was restrained by precipitation. In the energy-limited period, on the other hand, the majority of E scaled positively with solar radiation (R-g) and was confined by potential E ( E-p). E was most sensitive to the availability of soil moisture during the transition to the senescence period rather than onset of the greenness period, causing annual E to be strongly modulated by growing season length. Bulk surface conductance scaled consistently with Priestley-Taylor alpha coefficient regardless of interannual and seasonal variability of precipitation, E, and solar radiation.},

@article{casper_plant_1997,
	Abstract = {Belowground competition occurs when plants decrease the growth, survival, or fecundity of neighbors by reducing available soil resources. Competition belowground can be stronger and involve many more neighbors than aboveground competition. Physiological ecologists and population or community ecologists have traditionally studied belowground competition from different perspectives. Physiologically based studies often measure resource uptake without determining the integrated consequences for plant performance, while population or community level studies examine plant performance but fail to identify the resource intermediary or mechanism. Belowground competitive ability is correlated with such attributes as root density, surface area, and plasticity either in root growth or in the properties of enzymes involved in nutrient uptake. Unlike competition for light, in which larger plants have a disproportionate advantage by shading smaller ones, competition for soil resources is apparently more symmetric. Belowground competition often decreases with increases in nutrient levels, but it is premature to generalize about the relative importance of above-and belowground competition across resource gradients. Although shoot and root competition are often assumed to have additive effects on plant growth, some studies provide evidence to the contrary, and potential interactions between the two forms of competition should be considered in future investigations. Other research recommendations include the simultaneous study of root and shoot gaps, since their closures may not occur simultaneously, and improved estimates of the belowground neighborhood. Only by combining the tools and perspectives from physiological ecology and population and community biology can we fully understand how soil characteristics, neighborhood structure, and global climate change influence or are influenced by plant competition belowground.},

An additional complexity has been the recent evidence of limited interbreeding between modern humans and the Neandertals and Denisovans. Modern human migrations and interactions began during the buildup to the Last Glacial Maximum, starting about 100,000 years ago. By examining the history of other organisms through glacial cycles, valuable models for evolutionary biogeography can be formulated.

Knowledge of root profiles is invaluable in measuring and predicting ecosystem dynamics, yet data on root profiles are difficult to obtain. We developed an ecohydrological model of environmental forcing, soil moisture dynamics, and transpiration to explore dependencies of optimal rooting on edaphic, climatic, and physiological factors in water-limited ecosystems. The analysis considers individual plants with fixed biomass. Results of the optimization approach are consistent with profiles observed in nature. Optimal rooting was progressively deeper, moving from clay to loam, silt and then sand, and in wetter and cooler environments. Climates with the majority of the rainfall in winter produced deeper roots than if the rain fell in summer. Long and infrequent storms also favored deeper rooting. Plants that exhibit water stress at slight soil moisture deficiencies consistently showed deeper optimal root profiles. Silt generated the greatest sensitivity to differences in climatic and physiological parameters. The depth of rooting is governed by the depth to which water infiltrates, as influenced by soil properties and the timing and magnitude of water input and evaporative demand. These results provide a mechanistic illustration of the diversity of rooting strategies in nature.},

@article{craine_supply_2005,
	Abstract = {Concentration reduction theory is the leading theory regarding the mechanism of competition for nutrients in soils among plants, yet it has not been rigorously tested. Here we used a spatially explicit, fine-scale grid-based model that simulated diffusion and plant uptake of nutrients by plants in soil to test whether concentration reduction theory was appropriate for terrestrial plant competition for nutrients. In the absence of competition, increasing the rate of diffusion allows a plant to maintain positive growth rates below the lowest average concentration to which it can reduce nutrients in soil solution (R*). As such, differences among plants in the reduction of soil moisture, which here primarily affects nutrient diffusion, can cause R* to predict competitive success incorrectly. The stronger competitor for nutrients captures the largest proportion of the nutrient supply by ensuring nutrients contact its roots before those of a competitor. Although the metric derived from concentration reduction theory, R*, might have predictive power for competitive outcomes in terrestrial ecosystems, this evidence suggests that plants outcompete other plants for nutrients by pre-empting the supply, not reducing the average concentration.},

@article{ackerly_functional_2004,
	Abstract = {The study of interspecific variation in plant ecological strategies has revealed suites of traits associated with leaf life span and with maximum levels of water deficit (measured as leaf water potentials). Here, the relationship between these sets of traits was examined in a study of 20 co-occurring chaparral shrubs that vary in leaf habit, rooting depth, and regeneration strategies. Leaf life span (LLS) and minimum seasonal water potentials (ψmin) were not significantly correlated, suggesting that they are associated with independent aspects of functional variation. Multiple regression analyses of a large suite of physiological, functional, and phenological attributes in relation to these two "anchor traits" supported this view. Short LLS was significantly associated with high specific leaf area, high carbon assimilation and leaf nitrogen (per mass), early onset of growth, and a multistemmed, short stature growth form. This suite of traits was also associated with opportunistic regeneration following physical disturbance. Area-based gas exchange was not tightly linked to LLS. Low ψmin (i.e., greater water deficit) was associated with high wood density, small vessel diameters, thin twigs, low leaf area: sapwood area ratios, and early onset of leaf abscission. Among the evergreen species, this suite of traits was most characteristic of post-fire seeders, which depend on high drought tolerance for post-fire regeneration of seedlings. Plant stature was the only trait associated with both the LLS axis and the ψmin axis of functional variation. A two-dimensional strategy space, approximately defined by LLS and ψmin, can be used to distinguish contrasting strategies of drought tolerance vs. avoidance, and alternative modes of regeneration following fire and other disturbance. This conceptual scheme illustrates the strength of a trait-based approach to defining plant strategies in relation to resource availability and disturbance.},

	Abstract = {Observations by space-borne sensors can provide photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) intercepted by a canopy (IPAR), which, together with radiation use efficiency (RUE), can be used to estimate carbon assimilation by terrestrial plant communities. Evaluation of biological and environmental factors determining variability of RUE for daily total gross photosynthesis within and among species suggests a biophysically based approach for estimating daily total gross photosynthesis using satellite and ancillary data. Calculations have been done using leaf photosynthesis and canopy characteristics derived from field measurements for six cultivated herbaceous and 12 uncultivated (herbaceous and needle leaf and broadleaf woody) species, and mixed species stands of temperate deciduous forest and tropical moist and dry forests. These data are for 65 canopies, divided about equally between cultivated and uncultivated species, and the leaf area index varies between 0.6 and 9.5. A model for instantaneous canopy photosynthesis, considering sunlit and shaded leaves, variation of maximum rate of leaf photosynthesis within the canopy, and a solution of the radiative transfer equation for propagation of direct and diffuse PAR, is numerically integrated in space (angular variation of radiances and depth within the canopy) and time (diurnal variation) to obtain daily total gross photosynthesis and IPAR for varied incident irradiances. The results show that the maximum rate of leaf photosynthesis and magnitudes of direct and diffuse irradiance incident on the canopy are the major factors determining RUE for unstressed conditions. Also, while woody species on the average have lower RUE, they are found to utilize diffuse radiation more efficiently than cultivated species. Comparison of calculated RUE with observations for 10 cultivated species in varied environment gave differences of −23\% to +11\% for individual species, but aggregately they have almost equal coefficient of variation (∼25\%) and their averages differ by −6\% (underestimation). Monthly and annual gross photosynthesis determined using satellite and ancillary data are obtained for rain forest (in Brazil), boreal forest (in Canada), and cropland (in the United States). Annual photosynthesis calculated using satellite data for the three biomes differed from that determined from field measurements by −29\% to +15\%, averaging to +6\%. The above error estimates for RUE and photosynthesis are obtained without calibrating any model parameter.},

Information-theoretic approaches emphasise a deliberate focus on the a priori science in developing a set of multiple working hypotheses or models. Simple methods then allow these hypotheses (models) to be ranked from best to worst and scaled to reflect a strength of evidence using the likelihood of each model (g(i)), given the data and the models in the set (i.e. L(g(i){\textbackslash}data)). In addition, a variance component due to model-selection uncertainty is included in estimates of precision. There are many cases where formal inference can be based on all the models in the a priori set and this multi-model inference represents a powerful, new approach to valid inference. Finally, we strongly recommend inferences based on a priori considerations be carefully separated from those resulting from some form of data dredging. An example is given for questions related to age- and sex-dependent rates of tag loss in elephant seals (Mirounga leonina).},

	Abstract = {We tested whether plants allocate proportionately less biomass to roots in response to above-ground competition as predicted by optimal partitioning theory. Two population densities of Abutilon theophrasti were achieved by planting one individual per pot and varying spacing among pots so that plants in the two densities experienced the same soil volume but different degrees of canopy overlap. Density did not affect root:shoot ratio, the partitioning of biomass between fine roots and storage roots, fine root length, or root specific length. Plants growing in high density exhibited typical above-ground responses to neighbours, having higher ratios of stem to leaf biomass and greater leaf specific area than those growing in low density. Total root biomass and shoot biomass were highly correlated. However, storage root biomass was more strongly correlated with shoot biomass than was fine-root biomass. Fine-root length was correlated with above-ground biomass only for the small subcanopy plants in crowded populations. Because leaf surface area increased with biomass, the ratio between absorptive root surface area and transpirational leaf surface area declined with plant size, a relationship that could make larger plants more susceptible to drought. We conclude that A. theophrasti does not reallocate biomass from roots to shoots in response to above-ground competition even though much root biomass is apparently involved in storage and not in resource acquisition.},

@article{koons_transient_2005,
	Abstract = {Most environments are variable and disturbances (e.g., hurricanes, fires) can lead to substantial changes in a population's state (i.e., age, stage, or size distribution). In these situations, the long-term (i.e., asymptotic) measure of population growth rate (lambda(1)) may inaccurately represent population growth in the short-term. Thus, we calculated the short-term (i.e., transient) population growth rate and its sensitivity to changes in the life-cycle parameters for three bird and three mammal species with widely varying life histories. Further, we performed these calculations for initial population states that spanned the entire range of possibilities. Variation in a population's initial net reproductive value largely explained the variation in transient growth rates and their sensitivities to changes in life-cycle parameters (all AIC(c) {\textgreater}= 6.67 units better than the null model, all R-2 {\textgreater}= 0.55). Additionally, the transient fertility and adult survival sensitivities tended to increase with the initial net reproductive value of the population, whereas the sub-adult survival sensitivity decreased. Transient population dynamics of long-lived, slow reproducing species were more variable and more different than asymptotic dynamics than they were for short-lived, fast reproducing species. Because lambda(1) can be a biased estimate of the actual growth rate in the short-term (e.g., 19\% difference), conservation and wildlife biologists should consider transient dynamics when developing management plans that could affect a population's state, or whenever population state could be unstable.

@article{lehmann_savanna_2014,
	Abstract = {Ecologists have long sought to understand the factors controlling the structure of savanna vegetation. Using data from 2154 sites in savannas across Africa, Australia, and South America, we found that increasing moisture availability drives increases in fire and tree basal area, whereas fire reduces tree basal area. However, among continents, the magnitude of these effects varied substantially, so that a single model cannot adequately represent savanna woody biomass across these regions. Historical and environmental differences drive the regional variation in the functional relationships between woody vegetation, fire, and climate. These same differences will determine the regional responses of vegetation to future climates, with implications for global carbon stocks.
Surveying Savannas
Savannas are structurally similar across the three major continents where they occur, leading to the assumption that the factors controlling vegetation structure and function are broadly similar, too. Lehmann et al. (p. 548) report the results of an extensive analysis of ground-based tree abundance in savannas, sampled at more than 2000 sites in Africa, Australia, and South America. All savannas, independent of region, shared a common functional property in the way that moisture and fire regulated tree abundance. However, despite qualitative similarity in the moisture--fire--tree-biomass relationships among continents, key quantitative differences exist among the three regions, presumably as a result of unique evolutionary histories and climatic domains.},

A major reason for this is that we don't know how snapshot data on rooting differences translate into ecologically relevant patterns of water use at seasonal scales. We used stable isotopes in soil and stem water to quantify functional rooting profiles in grasses and two tree species in a South African savanna. Concurrently, we measured tree sap-flow velocity, grass canopy temperature (a transpiration correlate), and soil moisture content at multiple depths over the course of a growing season. We used lasso regression to identify the dominant soil moisture layers driving daily variation in tree and grass water-use metrics while controlling for weather variables. We found clear rooting depth differences between grasses (shallow) and trees (deep) from the isotopic data, and these patterns were strongly supported by the water-use data, which showed that grasses and trees predominantly responded to soil moisture availability at 5 and 40 cm depth, respectively. Our results provide a rare example of mechanistic support for the resource partitioning hypothesis in savannas, with important implications for our understanding of tree-grass dynamics under altered precipitation regimes.},

@article{urli_xylem_2013,
	Abstract = {Hydraulic failure is one of the main causes of tree mortality in conditions of severe drought. Resistance to cavitation is known to be strongly related to drought tolerance and species survival in conifers, but the threshold of water-stress-induced embolism leading to catastrophic xylem dysfunction in angiosperms has been little studied. We investigated the link between drought tolerance, survival and xylem cavitation resistance in five angiosperm tree species known to have contrasting desiccation resistance thresholds. We exposed seedlings in a greenhouse to severe drought to generate extreme water stress. We monitored leaf water potential, total plant water loss rate, leaf transpiration, stomatal conductance and CO2 assimilation rate during drought exposure and after rewatering (recovery phase). The time required for the recovery of 50\% of the maximum value of a given ecophysiological variable after rewatering was used to determine the critical water potential corresponding to the threshold beyond which the plant failed to recover. We also investigated the relationship between this potential and stem xylem cavitation resistance, as assessed from vulnerability curves. This minimum recoverable water potential was consistent between ecophysiological variables and varied considerably between species, from −3.4 to −6.0 MPa. This minimum recoverable water potential was strongly correlated with P50 and P88, the pressures inducing 50 and 88\% losses of stem hydraulic conductance, respectively. Moreover, the embolism threshold leading to irreversible drought damage was found to be close to 88\%, rather than the 50\% previously reported for conifers. Hydraulic failure leading to irreversible drought-induced global dysfunction in angiosperm tree species occurred at a very high level of xylem embolism, possibly reflecting the physiological characteristics of their stem water-transport system.},

@article{midgley_terrestrial_2010,
	Abstract = {The need to understand relationships between biodiversity and carbon cycling (including carbon sequestration) has risen in prominence owing to international interest both in preserving the terrestrial carbon pool and in conserving biodiversity. In this perspective, we highlight that achieving mutual benefits between these aims is clearly promoted by congruence between biodiversity and carbon stocks in tropical latitudes (i.e. high carbon, high biodiversity systems), revealed by recent data and modeling advances, but that mechanisms behind this congruence are not obvious. Furthermore, key processes at subtropical and higher latitudes with less obvious links to biodiversity require policy attention. These processes include wildfire in the subtropics (high biodiversity, low-carbon systems), and ecosystem-level respiration and decomposition at boreal and polar latitudes (low biodiversity, high carbon systems). No clear global relationship between biodiversity and carbon sequestration is apparent, but this does not preclude positive relationships at local to regional scales.

	Abstract = {The potential impact of climate change on biodiversity is well documented. A well developed range of statistical methods currently exists that projects the possible future habitat of a species directly from the current climate and a species distribution. However, studies incorporating ecological and evolutionary processes remain limited. Here, we focus on the potential role that local adaptation to climate may play in driving the range dynamics of sessile organisms. Incorporating environmental adaptation into a stochastic simulation yields several new insights. Counter-intuitively, our simulation results suggest that species with broader ranges are not necessarily more robust to climate change. Instead, species with broader ranges can be more susceptible to extinction as locally adapted genotypes are often blocked from range shifting by the presence of cooler adapted genotypes that persist even when their optimum climate has left them behind. Interestingly, our results also suggest that it will not always be the cold-adapted phenotypes that drive polewards range expansion. Instead, range shifts may be driven by phenotypes conferring adaptation to conditions prevalent towards the centre of a species' equilibrium distribution. This may have important consequences for the conservation method termed predictive provenancing. These initial results highlight the potential importance of local adaptation in determining how species will respond to climate change and we argue that this is an area requiring urgent theoretical and empirical attention.

	Abstract = {I present a model of stochastic community dynamics in which death occurs randomly in the community, propagules disperse randomly from a regional pool, and recruitment of new individuals of a species is proportional to the species local abundance multiplied by its local competitive ability. The competitive ability of a species is assumed to be determined by a function of one trait of the species, and I call this function the environmental filtering function. I show that information on local species abundances in a network of plots, together with trait data for each species, enables the inference of both the immigration rate and the environmental filtering function in each plot. I further study how the diversity patterns produced by this model deviate from the neutral predictions, and how this deviation depends on the characteristics of the environmental filtering function. I show that this inference framework is more powerful at detecting trait-based environmental filtering than existing statistical approaches based on trait distributions, and discuss how the predictions of this model could be used to assess environmental heterogeneity in a plot, to detect functionally meaningful trade-offs among species traits, and to test the assumption that there exists a simple relationship between species traits and local competitive ability.

However, carbon cycling processes such as soil CO2 flux, CO2 uptake by the dominant grasses, and aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) were reduced, and ANPP was more responsive to soil moisture variability than to mean soil water content.

In this paper, we propose an original evolutionary algorithm which is designed for the calibration of complex IBMs, i.e. characterized by high stochasticity, parameter uncertainty and numerous non-linear interactions between parameters and model output. Our algorithm corresponds to a variant of the population-based incremental learning (PBIL) genetic algorithm, with a specific "optimal individual" operator. The method is presented in detail and applied to the individual-based model OSMOSE. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated and estimated parameters are compared with an independent manual calibration. The results show that automated and convergent methods for inverse parameter estimation are a significant improvement to existing ad hoc methods for the calibration of IBMs. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

To do so, we introduced the use of elasticity analysis, which aims to measure the impact on MRT of a small change in one component, relative to the impact of equal changes in the other element. We also quantified the joint effect of LLS and RE on MRT, which required the calculation of the second derivatives of MRT with respect to LLS and RE. The estimation of the first derivatives showed that, although MRT increases linearly with LLS for a given value of RE, the relative effect of RE on MRT elasticity varies according to RE Values; when RE {\textgreater} 0.5, the MRT's elasticity increases exponentially. The calculation of the second derivatives confirmed the importance of RE on MRT's variation. We used the results of the elasticity analysis to analyze how MRT responded to variation in LLS and nitrogen RE on MRT at the intra- and interspecific levels. For this, we used 18 plant species from three stages of a Mediterranean old-field succession, grown in a common garden experiment at two levels of nitrogen supply.},

Because multiple evolutionary processes interact to generate quantitative variation in the degree of local maladaptation, we focus on how studying the ecological effects of maladaptation will lead to a more comprehensive view of how evolution can influence ecology. We explore how maladaptation can influence ecology through the lens of island biogeography theory, which yields some novel predictions, such as patch isolation increasing species richness.},

@article{zhang_fate_2015,
	Abstract = {There is considerable interest in understanding the fate of the Amazon over the coming century in the face of climate change, rising atmospheric CO2 levels, on-going land transformation, and changing fire regimes within the region. In this analysis, we explore the fate of Amazonian ecosystems under the combined impact of these four environmental forcings using three state-of-the-art terrestrial biosphere models (ED2, IBIS, and JULES) forced by three bias-corrected IPCC AR4 climate projections (PCM1, CCSM3, and HadCM3) under two land-use change scenarios. We assess the relative roles of climate change, CO2 fertilization, land-use change, and fire in driving the projected changes in Amazonian biomass and forest extent. Our results indicate that the impacts of climate change are primarily determined by the direction and severity of projected changes in regional precipitation: under the driest climate projection, climate change alone is predicted to reduce Amazonian forest cover by an average of 14\%. However, the models predict that CO2 fertilization will enhance vegetation productivity and alleviate climate-induced increases in plant water stress, and, as a result, sustain high biomass forests, even under the driest climate scenario. Land-use change and climate-driven changes in fire frequency are predicted to cause additional aboveground biomass loss and reductions in forest extent. The relative impact of land-use and fire dynamics compared to climate and CO2 impacts varies considerably, depending on both the climate and land-use scenario, and on the terrestrial biosphere model used, highlighting the importance of improved quantitative understanding of all four factors---climate change, CO2 fertilization effects, fire and land-use---to the fate of the Amazon over the coming century.

@article{guillemot_dynamic_2015,
	Abstract = {The extent to which forest growth is limited by carbon (C) supply (source control) or by cambial activity (sink control) will condition the response of trees to global changes. However, the physiological processes responsible for the limitation of forest growth are still under debate. The aim of this study is to evaluate the key drivers of the annual carbon allocation to wood along large soil and climate regional gradients in five tree species representative of the main European forest biomes (Fagus sylvatica, Quercus petraea, Quercus ilex, Quercus robur and Picea abies).
 Combining field measurements and process-based simulations at 49 sites (931 site-years), we assessed the stand biomass growth dependences at both inter-site and inter-annual scales. Specifically, the relative influence of forest C balance (source control), direct environmental control (water and temperature controls of sink activity) and allocation adjustments related to age, past climate conditions, competition intensity and soil nutrient availability on growth were quantified.
 The inter-site variability in stand C allocation to wood was predominantly driven by an age-related decline. The direct control of temperature or water stress on sink activity (i.e. independently from their effects on C supply) exerted a strong influence on the annual stand woody growth in all the species considered, including deciduous temperate species. The lagged effect of the past environment conditions was a significant driver of the annual C allocation to wood. Carbon supply appeared to strongly limit growth only in deciduous temperate species.
 We provide an evaluation of the spatio-temporal dynamics of annual carbon allocation to wood in European forests. Our study supports the premise that European forest growth is under a complex control including both source and sink limitations. The relative influences of the different growth drivers strongly vary across years and spatial ecological gradients. We suggest a straightforward modelling framework to implement these combined forest growth limitations into terrestrial biosphere models.},

@article{knorr_is_2009,
	Abstract = {Several recent studies have highlighted the possibility that the oceans and terrestrial ecosystems have started loosing part of their ability to sequester a large proportion of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions. This is an important claim, because so far only about 40\% of those emissions have stayed in the atmosphere, which has prevented additional climate change. This study re-examines the available atmospheric CO2 and emissions data including their uncertainties. It is shown that with those uncertainties, the trend in the airborne fraction since 1850 has been 0.7 +/- 1.4\% per decade, i.e. close to and not significantly different from zero. The analysis further shows that the statistical model of a constant airborne fraction agrees best with the available data if emissions from land use change are scaled down to 82\% or less of their original estimates. Despite the predictions of coupled climate-carbon cycle models, no trend in the airborne fraction can be found. Citation: Knorr, W.

	Abstract = {Range expansions of invading species in homogeneous environments have been extensively studied since the pioneer works by Fisher (Ann Eugen 7:255-369, 1937) and Skellam (Biometrika 38:196-218, 1951). However, environments for living organisms are often fragmented by natural or artificial habitat destruction. Here we address how such environmental heterogeneity affects the range expansion of invading species. We consider a single-species invasion in heterogeneous environments whose habitat parameters vary in a sinusoidal or quasi-sinusoidal manner. Accordingly, Fisher's model is modified to make the intrinsic growth rate and diffusion coefficient spatially variable. By numerically solving the model, we examine the spatio-temporal pattern of propagating waves, and predict the speed as a function of the amplitude and the wave length of the diffusion coefficient and the intrinsic growth rate. Firstly, the results demonstrate that in the sinusoidally varying environment, if the intrinsic growth rate solely oscillates, the speed increases with increases in the amplitude of oscillation. Conversely, if the diffusion coefficient solely oscillates, the speed decreases with increases in the amplitude of oscillation. When both the intrinsic growth rate and diffusion coefficient oscillate, the speed is synergistically accelerated if the oscillations are in anti-phase, whereas it is decelerated if the oscillations are in same phase. Secondly, the increase in the wave length in either the intrinsic growth rate or the diffusion coefficient leads to decreases in the speed. Thirdly, in the irregularly varying environment, the irregularity in the amplitude of the intrinsic growth rate enhances the speed, while that of the diffusion coefficient attenuates the speed.},

@article{lukac_forest_2009,
	Abstract = {Forest soils account for a large part of the stable carbon pool held in terrestrial ecosystems. Future levels of atmospheric CO2 are likely to increase C input into the soils through increased above- and below-ground production of forests. This increased input will result in greater sequestration of C only if the additional C enters stable pools. In this review, we compare current observations from four large-scale Free Air FACE Enrichment (FACE) experiments on forest ecosystems (EuroFACE, Aspen-FACE, Duke FACE and ORNL-FACE) and consider their predictive power for long-term C sequestration. At all sites, FACE increased fine root biomass, and in most cases higher fine root turnover resulted in higher C input into soil via root necromass. However, at all sites, soil CO2 efflux also increased in excess of the increased root necromass inputs. A mass balance calculation suggests that a large part of the stimulation of soil CO2 efflux may be due to increased root respiration. Given the duration of these experiments compared with the life cycle of a forest and the complexity of processes involved, it is not yet possible to predict whether elevated CO2 will result in increased C storage in forest soil.},

	Abstract = {Ecology Letters (2012) 15: 748758 Abstract Forest and savanna biomes dominate the tropics, yet factors controlling their distribution remain poorly understood. Climate is clearly important, but extensive savannas in some high rainfall areas suggest a decoupling of climate and vegetation. In some situations edaphic factors are important, with forest often associated with high nutrient availability. Fire also plays a key role in limiting forest, with fire exclusion often causing a switch from savanna to forest. These observations can be captured by a broad conceptual model with two components: (1) forest and savanna are alternative stable states, maintained by tree cover-fire feedbacks, (2) the interaction between tree growth rates and fire frequency limits forest development; any factor that increases growth (e.g. elevated availability of water, nutrients, CO2), or decreases fire frequency, will favour canopy closure. This model is consistent with the range of environmental variables correlated with forest distribution, and with the current trend of forest expansion, likely driven by increasing CO2 concentrations. Resolving the drivers of forest and savanna distribution has moved beyond simple correlative studies that are unlikely to establish ultimate causation. Experiments using Dynamic Global Vegetation Models, parameterised with measurements from each continent, provide an important tool for understanding the controls of these systems.},

	Abstract = {Aim (1) To estimate the local and global magnitude of carbon fluxes between savanna and the atmosphere, and to suggest the significance of savannas in the global carbon cycle. (2) To suggest the extent to which protection of savannas could contribute to a global carbon sequestration initiative. Location Tropical savanna ecosystems in Africa, Australia, India and South America. Methods A literature search was carried out using the ISI Web of Knowledge, and a compilation of extra data was obtained from other literature, including national reports accessed through the personal collections of the authors. Savanna is here defined as any tropical ecosystem containing grasses, including woodland and grassland types. From these data it was possible to estimate the fluxes of carbon dioxide between the entire savanna biome on a global scale. Results Tropical savannas can be remarkably productive, with a net primary productivity that ranges from 1 to 12 t C ha(-1) year(-1). The lower values are found in the arid and semi-arid savannas occurring in extensive regions of Africa, Australia and South America. The global average of the cases reviewed here was 7.2 t C ha(-1) year(-1). The carbon sequestration rate (net ecosystem productivity) may average 0.14 t C ha(-1) year(-1) or 0.39 Gt C year(-1). If savannas were to be protected from fire and grazing, most of them would accumulate substantial carbon and the sink would be larger. Savannas are under anthropogenic pressure, but this has been much less publicized than deforestation in the rain forest biome. The rate of loss is not well established, but may exceed 1\% per year, approximately twice as fast as that of rain forests. Globally, this is likely to constitute a flux to the atmosphere that is at least as large as that arising from deforestation of the rain forest. Main Conclusion The current rate of loss impacts appreciably on the global carbon balance. There is considerable scope for using many of the savannas as sites for carbon sequestration, by simply protecting them from burning and grazing, and permitting them to increase in stature and carbon content over periods of several decades.},

	Abstract = {Terrestrial carbon stock mapping is important for the successful implementation of climate change mitigation policies. Its accuracy depends on the availability of reliable allometric models to infer oven-dry aboveground biomass of trees from census data. The degree of uncertainty associated with previously published pantropical aboveground biomass allometries is large. We analyzed a global database of directly harvested trees at 58 sites, spanning a wide range of climatic conditions and vegetation types (4004 trees ≥ 5 cm trunk diameter). When trunk diameter, total tree height, and wood specific gravity were included in the aboveground biomass model as covariates, a single model was found to hold across tropical vegetation types, with no detectable effect of region or environmental factors. The mean percent bias and variance of this model was only slightly higher than that of locally fitted models. Wood specific gravity was an important predictor of aboveground biomass, especially when including a much broader range of vegetation types than previous studies. The generic tree diameter--height relationship depended linearly on a bioclimatic stress variable E, which compounds indices of temperature variability, precipitation variability, and drought intensity. For cases in which total tree height is unavailable for aboveground biomass estimation, a pantropical model incorporating wood density, trunk diameter, and the variable E outperformed previously published models without height. However, to minimize bias, the development of locally derived diameter--height relationships is advised whenever possible. Both new allometric models should contribute to improve the accuracy of biomass assessment protocols in tropical vegetation types, and to advancing our understanding of architectural and evolutionary constraints on woody plant development.},

	Abstract = {Adaptations of species to capture limiting resources is central for understanding structure and function of ecosystems. We studied the water economy of nine woody species differing in rooting depth in a Patagonian shrub steppe from southern Argentina to understand how soil water availability and rooting depth determine their hydraulic architecture. Soil water content and potentials, leaf water potentials (I-Leaf), hydraulic conductivity, wood density (rho(w)), rooting depth, and specific leaf area (SLA) were measured during two summers. Water potentials in the upper soil layers during a summer drought ranged from -2.3 to -3.6 MPa, increasing to -0.05 MPa below 150 cm. Predawn I-Leaf was used as a surrogate of weighted mean soil water potential because no statistical differences in I-Leaf were observed between exposed and covered leaves. Species-specific differences in predawn I-Leaf were consistent with rooting depths. Predawn I-Leaf ranged from -4.0 MPa for shallow rooted shrubs to -1.0 MPa for deep-rooted shrubs, suggesting that the roots of the latter have access to abundant moisture, whereas shallow-rooted shrubs are adapted to use water deposited mainly by small rainfall events. Wood density was a good predictor of hydraulic conductivity and SLA. Overall, we found that shallow rooted species had efficient water transport in terms of high specific and leaf specific hydraulic conductivity, low rho(w), high SLA and a low minimum I-Leaf that exhibited strong seasonal changes, whereas deeply rooted shrubs maintained similar minimum I-Leaf throughout the year, had stems with high rho(w) and low hydraulic conductivity and leaves with low SLA. These two hydraulic syndromes were the extremes of a continuum with several species occupying different portions of a gradient in hydraulic characteristics. It appears that the marginal cost of having an extensive root system (e.g., high rho(w) and root hydraulic resistance) contributes to low growth rates of the deeply rooted species.},

	Abstract = {Aim To test whether it is possible to establish a common biogeographical regionalization for plants and vertebrates in sub-Saharan Africa (the Afrotropical Region), using objective multivariate methods. Location Sub-Saharan Africa (Afrotropical Region). Methods We used 1 degrees grid cell resolution databases for birds, mammals, amphibians and snakes (4142 vertebrate species) and c. 13\% of the plants (5881 species) from the Afrotropical Region. These databases were analysed using cluster analysis techniques to define biogeographical regions. A beta(sim) dissimilarity matrix was subjected to a hierarchical classification using the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic averages (UPGMA). The five group-specific biogeographical regionalizations were compared against a regionalization developed from a combined database, and a regionalization that is maximally congruent with the five group-specific datasets was determined using a consensus classification. The regionalizations were interpreted against measures of spatial turnover in richness and composition for the five datasets as well as the combined dataset. Results We demonstrate the existence of seven well-defined and consistent biogeographical regions in sub-Saharan Africa. These regionalizations are statistically defined and robust between groups, with minor taxon-specific biogeographical variation. The proposed biogeographical regions are: Congolian, Zambezian, Southern African, Sudanian, Somalian, Ethiopian and Saharan. East Africa, the West African coast, and the transitions between the Congolian, Sudanian and Zambezian regions are unassigned. The Cape area in South Africa, Afromontane areas and the coastal region of East Africa do not emerge as distinct regions but are characterized by high neighbourhood heterogeneity, rapid turnover of species and high levels of narrow endemism. Main conclusions Species distribution data and modern cluster analysis techniques can be used to define biogeographical regions in Africa that reflect the patterns found in both vertebrates and plants. The consensus of the regionalizations between different taxonomic groups is high. These regions are broadly similar to those proposed using expert opinion approaches. Some previously proposed transitional zones are not recognized in this classification.},

	Abstract = {The components of the Amazon water budget and their spatiotemporal variability are diagnosed using monthly averaged remote sensing-based data products for the period September 2002-December 2006. The large Amazon basin is divided into 14 smaller watersheds, and for each of these sub-basins, fresh water discharge is estimated from the water balance equation using satellite data products. The purpose of this study is to learn how to apply satellite data with global coverage over the large tropical regions; therefore several combinations of remote sensing estimates including total water storage changes, precipitation and evapotranspiration. The results are compared to gauge-based measurements and the best spatiotemporal agreement between estimated and observed runoff is within 1 mm/d for the combination of precipitation from the GPCP and the Montana evapotranspiration product. Mean annual precipitation, evapotranspiration and runoff for the whole basin are estimated to be 6.3, 2.27 and 3.02 mm/d respectively but also show large spatial and temporal variations at sub-basin scale. Using the most consistent data combination, the seasonal dynamics of the water budget within the Amazon system are examined. Agreement between satellite based and in situ runoff is improved when lag-times between sub-basins are included (RMSE from 0.98 to 0.61 mm/d). We estimate these lag times based on satellite-inferred inundation extents. The results reveal not only variations of the basin forcing but also the complex response of the inter-connected sub-basin (SB) water budgets. Inter-annual and inter-SB variation of the water components are investigated and show large anomalies in northwestern and eastern downstream SBs; aggregate behavior of the whole Amazon is more complex than can be represented by a simple integral of the forcing over the whole river system.},

	Abstract = {Metapopulation dynamics and epidemiology of some diseases on sessile hosts (like pathogen fungi/tree interactions) can be modelled by contact processes on a graph. There exist several recent work on the structure of a graph, with classical notion like degree, diameter, small world property, etc., but quite fewer work on dynamics on graphs. Here, we model time discrete contact process on graphs with known degree distribution, with local mortality and spread along the edges with constant diffusion coefficient. We show that the knowledge of the degree distribution only leads to a mean field approximation only of the contact process. The fraction of infected hosts (or occupied patches) is modelled as a function of the degree of the vertex. As a consequence of mean field approximation, the stationary distribution at equilibrium belongs to a universal family of curves, which is independent of the degree distribution. An analytic description of this family is given. Each curve in the family is identified by one parameter only, which can be the mean infection rate (or occupancy rate) for the whole graph, obtained as a solution of an implicit equation containing the degree distribution. Finally, an exact equation relating the density of occupancy and the probability for types of edges is given, as a first step towards pair approximation on graphs. (c) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Predictive relationships describing the hydraulic parameter distributions must be developed based on the common descriptors of the physical properties of soils (e.g., texture, structure, particle size distribution). Covariation among the hydraulic parameters within these relationships must be identified. Data for 1448 soil samples were examined in an evaluation of the usefulness of qualitative descriptors as predictors of soil hydraulic behavior. Analysis of variance and multiple linear regression techniques were used to derive quantitative expressions for the moments of the hydraulic parameters as functions of the particle size distributions (percent sand, silt, and clay content) of soils. Discriminant analysis suggests that the covariation of the hydraulic parameters can be used to construct a classification scheme based on the hydraulic behavior of soils that is analogous to the textural classification scheme based on the sand, silt, and clay content of soils.},

	Abstract = {Background and Aims The co-occurring of evergreen and deciduous angiosperm trees in Asian tropical dry forests on karst substrates suggests the existence of different water-use strategies among species. In this study it is hypothesized that the co-occurring evergreen and deciduous trees differ in stem hydraulic traits and leaf water relationships, and there will be correlated evolution in drought tolerance between leaves and stems.
Methods A comparison was made of stem hydraulic conductivity, vulnerability curves, wood anatomy, leaf life span, leaf pressure--volume characteristics and photosynthetic capacity of six evergreen and six deciduous tree species co-occurring in a tropical dry karst forest in south-west China. The correlated evolution of leaf and stem traits was examined using both traditional and phylogenetic independent contrasts correlations.
Key Results It was found that the deciduous trees had higher stem hydraulic efficiency, greater hydraulically weighted vessel diameter (Dh) and higher mass-based photosynthetic rate (Am); while the evergreen species had greater xylem-cavitation resistance, lower leaf turgor-loss point water potential (π0) and higher bulk modulus of elasticity. There were evolutionary correlations between leaf life span and stem hydraulic efficiency, Am, and dry season π0. Xylem-cavitation resistance was evolutionarily correlated with stem hydraulic efficiency, Dh, as well as dry season π0. Both wood density and leaf density were closely correlated with leaf water-stress tolerance and Am.
Conclusions The results reveal the clear distinctions in stem hydraulic traits and leaf water-stress tolerance between the co-occurring evergreen and deciduous angiosperm trees in an Asian dry karst forest. A novel pattern was demonstrated linking leaf longevity with stem hydraulic efficiency and leaf water-stress tolerance. The results show the correlated evolution in drought tolerance between stems and leaves.},

	Abstract = {Fire-evolved forests that historically had high fire return intervals ({\textless} 100 years) in the western United States are currently overstocked with fuels due to a century or more of fire suppression and anthropogenic modification. Additionally, some western rangelands have changed composition from fire maintained grasslands to grazed shrublands. Land managers are beginning to reintroduce fire to these ecosystems as a functional component. Estimating fire behavior through the use of computer simulations is one tool to assist in planning management-ignited fire. We evaluated the sensitivity of the fire model FARSITE to the level of detail in the fuels data, both spatially and quantitatively, to better understand requirements for mapping fuels to produce accurate fire simulations. Simulated fires generated using site specific fuel models mapped at 30 m and degraded to 210 m were compared to fires simulated using standard generic Northern Forest Fire Laboratory (NFFL) fuel types. Eight classes of surface fuels were mapped by classification of satellite imagery with an overall accuracy of 0.78. A percent tree canopy cover map was created from digital orthophotos using a linear regression model with an R-adj(2) = 0.93 of field sampled percent canopy cover data to a tree canopy shadow model. The dominant site specific fuel model (63\% cover) was found to agree with the most suitable NFFL fuel model. Site specific fuel models mapped at fine resolution were found to produce statistically smaller fire areas than those produced with generic fuel models mapped at a fine scale and site specific fuels mapped at a coarse scale. In the worst case scenario (low fuel moistures and high wind speeds) the average fire size was about 20\% larger with the fuel map using NFFL fuel models than with the fine scale map using site specific fuel models.

	Abstract = {The dynamics of vegetation is formulated in terms of the allometric and structural properties of plants. Within the framework of a general and yet parsimonious approach, we focus on the relationship between the morphology of individual plants and the spatial organization of vegetation populations. So far, in theoretical as well as in field studies, this relationship has received only scant attention. The results reported remedy to this shortcoming. They highlight the importance of the crown/root ratio and demonstrate that the allometric relationship between this ratio and plant development plays an essential part in all matters regarding ecosystems stability under conditions of limited soil (water) resources. This allometry determines the coordinates in parameter space of a critical point that controls the conditions in which the emergence of self-organized biomass distributions is possible. We have quantified this relationship in terms of parameters that are accessible by measurement of individual plant characteristics. It is further demonstrated that, close to criticality, the dynamics of plant populations is given by a variational Swift-Hohenberg equation. The evolution of vegetation in response to increasing aridity, the conditions of gapped pattern formation and the conditions under which desertification takes place are investigated more specifically. It is shown that desertification may occur either as a local desertification process that does not affect pattern morphology in the course of its unfolding or as a gap coarsening process after the emergence of a transitory, deeply gapped pattern regime. Our results amend the commonly held interpretation associating vegetation patterns with a Turing instability. They provide a more unified understanding of vegetation self-organization within the broad context of matter order-disorder transitions.},

	Abstract = {(1) This paper compares the aggressive and feeding behaviour of oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus feeding on preferred mussel Mytilus edulis beds, where bird density was high, with the behaviour of birds feeding on the least preferred bed, where bird density was low. (2) As predicted, it was the least aggressive of the immature birds that left the preferred beds first as the adults returned from the breeding grounds from July to October. The immatures that remained had similar aggression scores to adults. (3) Aggressive encounters occurred much more frequently on the preferred beds than on the least preferred beds. There were highly significant differences in aggressiveness between individuals feeding on the most preferred beds, but not amongst those feeding on the low density bed. (4) Intake rate was significantly correlated with aggressiveness amongst eighteen individuals studied on the preferred beds but not amongst the eighteen individuals studied on the least preferred bed. It is suggested that this difference was mainly due to the amount of aggression, and, particularly of robbing, differing between the beds. On the most preferred beds, robbing depressed the intake rate of the less aggressive birds and enhanced that of the most aggressive ones. This was not the case on the least preferred bed as encounters were so rare. The results are discussed in relation to the hypothesis that oystercatchers compete for some of the mussel beds on the Exe.},

	Abstract = {{\textless}P{\textgreater}Leaf based models of net photosynthesis (A$_{\textrm{n}}$) and stomatal conductance (g) are often components of whole plant, canopy and regional models of net primary productivity and surface energy balance. Since C$_{\textrm{4}}$ metabolism shows unique responses to environmental conditions and C$_{\textrm{4}}$ species are important agriculturally and ecologically, a realistic and accurate leaf model specific to C$_{\textrm{4}}$ plants is needed. In this paper we develop a simple model for predicting A$_{\textrm{n}}$ and g from leaves of C$_{\textrm{4}}$ plants that is easily parameterised and that predicts many of the important environmental responses. {\textless}P{\textgreater}{\textless}/P{\textgreater}        We derive the leaf model from a simple biochemical-intercellular transport model of C$_{\textrm{4}}$ photosynthesis that includes inorganic carbon fixation by PEP carboxylase, light dependent generation of PEP and RuBP, rubisco reaction kinetics, and the diffusion of inorganic carbon and O$_{\textrm{2}}$ between the bundle sheath and mesophyll. We argue that under most conditions these processes can be described simply as three potentially limiting steps. The leaf photosynthesis model treats A$_{\textrm{n}}$ as first order with respect to either light, CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ or the amount of rubisco present and produces a continuous transition between limitations. The independent variables of the leaf photosynthesis model are leaf temperature (T$_{\textrm{I}}$), intercellular CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ levels and the absorbed quantum flux. {\textless}P{\textgreater}{\textless}/P{\textgreater}        A simple linear model of g in terms of A$_{\textrm{n}}$ and leaf surface CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ level (p$_{\textrm{s}}$) and relative humidity (h$_{\textrm{s}}$) is combined with the photosynthesis model to give leaf photosynthesis as a function of absorbed quantum flux, T$_{\textrm{1}}$ and p$_{\textrm{s}}$ and h$_{\textrm{s}}$ levels. {\textless}P{\textgreater}{\textless}/P{\textgreater}        Gas exchange measurements from corn leaves exposed to varied light, CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ and temperature levels are used to parameterise and test the models. Model parameters are determined by fitting the models to a set of 21 measurements. The behaviour of the models is compared with an independent set of 71 measurements, and the predictions are shown to be highly correlated with the data. {\textless}P{\textgreater}{\textless}/P{\textgreater}        Under most conditions the leaf model can be parameterised simply by determining the level of rubisco in the leaves. The effects of light environment, nutritional status and water stress levels on A$_{\textrm{n}}$ and g can be accounted for by appropriate adjustment of the capacity for rubisco to fix CO$_{\textrm{2}}$. We estimate rubsico capacity from CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ and light saturated photosynthesis although leaf nitrogen content or rubisco assays from leaf extracts could also be used for this purpose.{\textless}/P{\textgreater}},

	Abstract = {1 Savanna ecosystems are characterized by the codominance of two different life forms: grasses and trees. An operational understanding of how these two different life forms coexist is essential for understanding savanna function and for predicting its response to future environmental change. 2 The existing model, which proposes that grasses and trees coexist by a separation of rooting niches, is not supported by recent empirical investigations. Our aim was to define an alternative mechanism of grass--tree coexistence in savanna ecosystems. The model we have built concentrates on life history--disturbance interactions between grasses and trees. 3 The model demonstrates coexistence for a wide range of environmental conditions, and exhibits long periods of slow decline in adult tree numbers interspersed with relatively infrequent recruitment events. Recruitment is controlled by rainfall, which limits seedling establishment, and fire, which prevents recruitment into adult size classes. Decline in adult tree numbers is the result of continuing, but low levels, of adult mortality. Both aspects of the dynamics are consistent with an established non-equilibrium mechanism of coexistence (the storage effect). 4 A sensitivity analysis indicated that data on tree resprouting ability, stem growth rates and the relationship between seedling establishment and wet season drought are essential for predicting both the range of conditions for which coexistence is possible and the response of savanna ecosystems to environmental change. 5 Our analysis suggests that understanding grass--tree interactions in savanna requires consideration of the long-term effects of life history--disturbance interactions on demography, rather than the fine-scale effects of resource competition on physiological performance.},

Under the effect of proportional harvest, we give a sufficient condition for a population to extinguish, and we show that the magnitude of proportional harvest depends on the resources available to the population. We show that the harvesting yield can be periodic, quasi-periodic or chaotic, depending on the dynamics of the harvested population. For populations with large fertility numbers, small harvesting mortality leads to abrupt extinction, but larger harvesting mortality leads to controlled population numbers by avoiding over consumption of resources. Harvesting can be a strategy in order to stabilise periodic or quasi-periodic oscillations in the number of individuals of a population. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {P{\textgreater}Second-generation Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) have recently been developed that explicitly represent the ecological dynamics of disturbance, vertical competition for light, and succession. Here, we introduce a modified second-generation DGVM and examine how the representation of demographic processes operating at two-dimensional spatial scales not represented by these models can influence predicted community structure, and responses of ecosystems to climate change. The key demographic processes we investigated were seed advection, seed mixing, sapling survival, competitive exclusion and plant mortality. We varied these parameters in the context of a simulated Amazon rainforest ecosystem containing seven plant functional types (PFTs) that varied along a trade-off surface between growth and the risk of starvation induced mortality. Varying the five unconstrained parameters generated community structures ranging from monocultures to equal co-dominance of the seven PFTs. When exposed to a climate change scenario, the competing impacts of CO2 fertilization and increasing plant mortality caused ecosystem biomass to diverge substantially between simulations, with mid-21st century biomass predictions ranging from 1.5 to 27.0 kg C m-2. Filtering the results using contemporary observation ranges of biomass, leaf area index (LAI), gross primary productivity (GPP) and net primary productivity (NPP) did not substantially constrain the potential outcomes. We conclude that demographic processes represent a large source of uncertainty in DGVM predictions.},

	Abstract = {We examined variation in leaf size and specific leaf area (SLA) in relation to the distribution of 22 chaparral shrub species on small-scale gradients of aspect and elevation. Potential incident solar radiation (insolation) was estimated from a geographic information system to quantify microclimate affinities of these species across north- and south-facing slopes. At the community level, leaf size and SLA both declined with increasing insolation, based on average trait values for the species found in plots along the gradient. However, leaf size and SLA were not significantly correlated across species, suggesting that these two traits are decoupled and associated with different aspects of performance along this environmental gradient. For individual species, SLA was negatively correlated with species distributions along the insolation gradient, and was significantly lower in evergreen versus deciduous species. Leaf size exhibited a negative but non-significant trend in relation to insolation distribution of individual species. At the community level, variance in leaf size increased with increasing insolation. For individual species, there was a greater range of leaf size on south-facing slopes, while there was an absence of small-leaved species on north-facing slopes. These results demonstrate that analyses of plant functional traits along environmental gradients based on community level averages may obscure important aspects of trait variation and distribution among the constituent species.},

	Abstract = {A mathematical model is presented which predicts the shape of a sunflower receptacle (or the compact receptacle of various other taxa) and the pattern of its floral parts (florets) from the time of their initiation to maturity. The model assumes that the expansion and curving of the receptacle surface is just sufficient to accommodate the development of the florets, thus minimizing the quantity of plant tissue involved. The model assumes a fixed angular separation (divergence) between successive florets, an S-shaped (sigmoidal) growth function followed by each florets, and a fixed time delay (period) between the initiation of successive florets. It is further assumes that the shape and relative position occupied by the florets on the receptacle surface are invariant in time. By this theory, the shape of the receptacle surface is fully determined once the mathematical form of the growth function is specified. Using the logistic growth function, the theory is tested against the measured shapes of plant receptacles from different taxa at various points in their development. The least-squares adjusted fits to the theory are, in most cases, very good indeed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {DGVMs exploit the power of modern computers and computational methods to yield a predictive description of land ecosystem processes that takes account of knowledge previously developed through long histories of separate disciplinary approaches to the study of the biosphere. The degree of interaction between the different scientific approaches still falls far short of optimal; thus, DGVM developers have a responsibility to be aware of progress in several disciplines in order to ensure that their models remain state-of-the-art. We have presented a series of case studies of the evaluation of DGVMs that demonstrate the predictive capability that current models have achieved. Nevertheless, there are plenty of unresolved issues --- differences among models that are not well understood, important processes that are omitted or treated simplistically by some or all models, and sets of observations that are not satisfactorily reproduced by current models. More comprehensive ``benchmarking'' of DGVMs against multiple data sets is required and would be most effectively carried out through an international consortium, so as to avoid duplicating the large amount of work involved in selecting and processing data sets and model experiments. We have also presented a series of case studies that illustrate the power of DGVMs, even with their known limitations, in explaining a remarkable variety of Earth System phenomena and in addressing contemporary issues related to climate and land-use change. These case studies encourage us to believe that the continued development of DGVMs is a worthwhile enterprise. Finally, new directions in Earth System Science point to a range of aspects in which DGVMs could be improved so as to take account of recently acquired knowledge, such as experimental work on whole-ecosystem responses to environmental modification and new understanding of the functional basis of plant traits; complemented by an effort to represent semi-natural and agricultural ecosystems and the impacts of different management practices on these ecosystems; and extended to include processes such as trace-gas emissions, which are important in order to understand the functional role of the terrestrial biosphere in the Earth System. Together, these potential developments add up to an ambitious research program, requiring the economies of scale that only an international collaborative effort can provide.},

We review the success or otherwise of work investigating alternative processes and mechanisms, most of which fall under the heading of cooperation for direct benefits. We evaluate to what extent concepts such as by-product benefits, pseudo-reciprocity, sanctions and partner choice, markets and the build-up of cross-species spatial trait correlations have contributed to the study of the evolution of cooperation. We conclude that these alternative ideas are successful and show potential to further increase our understanding of cooperation. We also bring up the origin and role of common interest in the evolution of cooperation, including the appearance of organisms. We note that there are still unresolved questions about the main processes contributing to the evolution of common interest. Commenting on the broader significance of the recent developments, we argue that they represent a justified balancing of the importance given to different major hypotheses for the evolution of cooperation. This balancing is beneficial because it widens considerably the range of phenomena addressed and, crucially, encourages empirical testing of important theoretical alternatives.},

	Abstract = {A simple ecological model underlies contemporary fire policy in Man. West African countries. The model holds that the timing (or seasonality) of annual savanna fires is a principal determinant of vegetation cover. The model's origin can be traced to the ideas held by influential colonial scientists who viewed anthropogenic fire as a prime force of regional environmental degradation. The main evidence in support of the model derives from the results of a series of long-term burning experiments carried out during last century. The experimental results have been repeatedly mapped onto fire policy often taking the form of a three-tiered model in which fire exclusion is considered the ultimate management objective, late dry-season fire is discouraged and early dry-season fire is allowed but only under specific, often state-controlled circumstances. This paper provides a critique of contemporary fire policy in the region and the fire ecology model on which it is based. Through an analysis of burn scars for the 2002-3 fire season generated from ETM+ imagery, the study documents the spatiotemporal pattern of burning for an area in southern Mali. It argues that current policy, which is informed by an a-spatial model, cannot adequately account for the critical pattern of burning that is characteristic of the region. A reinterpretation of the burning experiments is presented in light of four factors: empirical data; recent developments in patch-mosaic theory; historical evidence on the effects of fire suppression; and data on indigenous burning strategies, all of which suggest a need to reconsider current fire policy.},

	Abstract = {Savannas are globally important ecosystems of great significance to human economies. In these biomes, which are characterized by the co-dominance of trees and grasses, woody cover is a chief determinant of ecosystem properties. The availability of resources (water, nutrients) and disturbance regimes (fire, herbivory) are thought to be important in regulating woody cover, but perceptions differ on which of these are the primary drivers of savanna structure. Here we show, using data from 854 sites across Africa, that maximum woody cover in savannas receiving a mean annual precipitation (MAP) of less than approximately 650 mm is constrained by, and increases linearly with, MAP. These arid and semi-arid savannas may be considered 'stable' systems in which water constrains woody cover and permits grasses to coexist, while fire, herbivory and soil properties interact to reduce woody cover below the MAP-controlled upper bound. Above a MAP of approximately 650 mm, savannas are 'unstable' systems in which MAP is sufficient for woody canopy closure, and disturbances (fire, herbivory) are required for the coexistence of trees and grass. These results provide insights into the nature of African savannas and suggest that future changes in precipitation may considerably affect their distribution and dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Abstract  Conspecific attraction is the preferential settlement into habitat patches with conspecifics. To be a good proximate strategy, fitness gains from settling with conspecifics must outweigh the costs of higher conspecific densities, such as intraspecific competition. Two types of benefits have been proposed to explain conspecific attraction: Allee effects (i.e., positive density dependence) and conspecific cueing (using conspecifics as an indicator of habitat quality). I present empirical evidence for conspecific attraction in the settlement of the porcelain crab, Petrolisthes cinctipes Randall (Anomura: Porcellanidae). Previous work demonstrated that P. cinctipes experiences strong intraspecific competition and that both Allee effects and conspecific cueing are present in P. cinctipes life-history. I developed an empirically-based fitness model of the costs and benefits of settling with conspecifics. Based on this model, I simulated optimal settlement to habitat patches that varied in conspecific density and habitat quality, where the correlation between density and habitat quality determined the level of conspecific cueing. I tested whether Allee effects alone, conspecific cueing alone, or Allee effects and conspecific cueing together could provide an ultimate explanation for the proximate settlement behavior of P. cinctipes. The settlement simulation was consistent with empirical settlement only when Allee effects and conspecific cueing were both included. Three life-history features are critical to this conclusion: (1) fitness is maximized at intermediate density, (2) fitness depends on the decisions of previous settlers, and (3) conspecific density provides good information about habitat quality. The quality of information garnered from conspecifics determines whether conspecific attraction is a good proximate strategy for settlement. I present a graphical illustration demonstrating how Allee effects and conspecific cueing work together to influence fitness, providing a conceptual framework for other systems.},

	Abstract = {The historical regulation of African elephant Loxodonta africana populations could provide guidelines for management efforts and decisions in areas where elephant numbers are now increasing. However, there are few detailed records of the natural mortality processes of the past. Therefore, we modelled elephant population growth to evaluate possible effects of age-specific mortality. Model projections indicated that an annual mortality of 17.1\% of juveniles or 10.5\% of adults would be sufficient to prevent population growth. For age classes below or just at sexual maturity (i.e. 0-3, 4-7, 8-11) 37.5\% annual mortality of one of these classes was required to achieve 0\% population growth. These mortality levels are much higher than those reported in southern Africa today. Simulations of episodic mortality events (e.g. droughts) indicated that such events would need to occur every 16 years at a severity that would cause the mortality of all infants and weaned calves (0-7 years old), as well as 10\% of adults and subadults (8-60 years old) to prevent long-term population growth. An 8-year frequency required the mortality of 84.7\% of infants and weaned calves. Historically, it is possible that high drought mortality and frequency, and high predation levels, may have reduced population growth significantly but current mortality rates and frequencies are insufficient to constrain long-term average population growth at 0\%. The natural limitation of existent elephant populations through mortality is therefore unlikely, indicating a need for active management of the increasing elephant populations in southern Africa.},

	Abstract = {Extensive rangelands and other vegetation types that we know today formed while atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration was low (50 to 75\% of today's concentration). Fossil fuel burning and deforestation and other land me changes during the last 200 years have increased CO2 concentration by about 30\%, to the present 360 parts per million (ppm). Atmospheric CO2 will continue to rise during the next century, possibly to concentrations that are unprecedented for the last several million years. Much of the potential importance of CO2 concentration to vegetation derives from its influence on plant carbon balance and water relations. Plants grow by assimilating CO2 that diffuses into leaves through stomatal pores. Inevitably associated with CO2 uptake is transpirational loss of water vapor through stomata. Transpiration rates usually decline as CO2 increases, while, in many plants, photosynthesis and growth increase. These ''primary'' responses to CO2 can lead to a multitude of changes at the plant and ecosystem levels, ranging from alteration of the chemical composition of plant tissues to changes in ecosystem function and the species composition of plant communities. The direct physiological responses of plants to CO2 and expression of these responses at higher scales differ among species and growing conditions. Growth response to CO2 is usually highest in rapidly-growing plants that quickly export the carbohydrates formed in leaves and use them for storage or new growth and allocate a high proportion of fixed carbon to produce leaves. Growth is also more responsive to CO2 in plants with the C-3 (most woody plants and 'cool-season' grasses) than C-4 photosynthetic pathway (most 'warm-season' grasses), These and other differences among species could lead to changes in the composition of rangeland vegetation, but generalizations are difficult. On many rangelands, species abundances are determined more by morphological and phenological attributes that influence plant access to essential resources like nitrogen and light and reaction to fire, grazing, and other disturbances than by physiological traits that are sensitive to CO2 concentration. Species composition probably will be most responsive to CO2 on moderately water-limited and disturbed rangelands where multiple positive effects of CO2 on plant water relations can be expressed and competition for light is minimized. Greatest initial changes in species composition likely will occur on C-3/C-4 grasslands and at the transition between grasslands and woodlands. Plant production should also increase on water-limited rangelands, but CO2 may have little influence on production when nutrient elements like nitrogen are severely Limiting.},

Unlike other C-14 techniques, tandem accelerator mass spectrometry (TAMS) counts the number of carbon isotope atoms, permitting high precision with small samples. Aboveground nuclear bomb tests caused atmospheric C-14 levels to peak in 1963. Their subsequent gradual decline provides a signal for aging seed banks with TAMS. We constructed a calibration curve using seeds with known dates of production during 1980-1995, then used it to age 53 seeds sampled from a natural seed bank in 1993, at the Desert Laboratory in Tucson, Arizona. Seed number declined with age at an approximately exponential rate, with the oldest recovered seed having an estimated age of 5 yr (95\% cr = +/-2.3 yr). The seed bank age structure was judged more than adequate to buffer this population from typical fluctuations, based on an examination of 15 yr of population dynamic data. The TAMS technique has strong potential for answering a broad range of ecological and evolutionary questions requiring post-1963 age determinations and for which a several-year confidence interval is acceptable.},

@article{freckleton_detecting_2000,
	Abstract = {Recent models have shown that the development of spatial structure in plant mixtures may make strong competitive interactions between species hard to detect owing to spatial segregation of the competing species. Here we address the issue of measuring interspecific competition using a simulation based on a neighbourhood population model which assumes that both dispersal and competitive interactions are localized. Using known parameter combinations we use the model to test the power and efficiency of two approaches for detecting and measuring competition. The first approach is based on measuring the response of communities to the removal of neighbours. Measures of interspecific competition based on this approach are extremely biased by spatial segregation of species, although this bias may be partially overcome by altering the spatial scale at which the effects of removals are recorded. The second approach is based on multiple regression of per capita population growth rates on local densities of the interacting species. When dispersal is restricted, the regression approach provides accurate estimates of interspecific competition coefficients when the scale of the sampling unit (i.e. the quadrats within which plants are counted) is large compared to the scale at which interactions and dispersal occur. When seeds disperse globally the removal method performs best; the regression method fails because sampling units do not form closed dynamic systems. Our results highlight the importance of tailoring methods for detecting competition to the characteristics of the species in question. They also indicate that rapid nonmanipulative estimates of competition coefficients may be the best approach in communities where dispersal is restricted and competitive interactions localized, which is likely to be the case for the majority of plants.},

@article{adler_trait-based_2013,
	Abstract = {Recent functional trait studies have shown that trait differences may favour certain species (environmental filtering) while simultaneously preventing competitive exclusion (niche partitioning). However, phenomenological trait-dispersion analyses do not identify the mechanisms that generate niche partitioning, preventing trait-based prediction of future changes in biodiversity. We argue that such predictions require linking functional traits with recognised coexistence mechanisms involving spatial or temporal environmental heterogeneity, resource partitioning and natural enemies. We first demonstrate the limitations of phenomenological approaches using simulations, and then (1) propose trait-based tests of coexistence, (2) generate hypotheses about which plant functional traits are likely to interact with particular mechanisms and (3) review the literature for evidence for these hypotheses. Theory and data suggest that all four classes of coexistence mechanisms could act on functional trait variation, but some mechanisms will be stronger and more widespread than others. The highest priority for future research is studies of interactions between environmental heterogeneity and trait variation that measure environmental variables at within-community scales and quantify species' responses to the environment in the absence of competition. Evidence that similar trait-based coexistence mechanisms operate in many ecosystems would simplify biodiversity forecasting and represent a rare victory for generality over contingency in community ecology.},

	Abstract = {We will elaborate the evolutionary course of an ecosystem consisting of a population in a chemostat environment with periodically fluctuating nutrient supply. The organisms that make up the population consist of structural biomass and energy storage compartments. In a constant chemostat environment a species without energy storage always out-competes a species with energy reserves. This hinders evolution of species with storage from those without storage. Using the adaptive dynamics approach for non-equilibrium ecological systems we will show that in a fluctuating environment there are multiple stable evolutionary singular strategies (ss's): one for a species without, and one for a species with energy storage. The evolutionary end-point depends on the initial evolutionary state. We will formulate the invasion fitness in terms of Floquet multipliers for the oscillating non-autonomous system. Bifurcation theory is used to study points where due to evolutionary development by mutational steps, the long-term dynamics of the ecological system changes qualitatively. To that end, at the ecological time scale, the trait value at which invasion of a mutant into a resident population becomes possible can be calculated using numerical bifurcation analysis where the trait is used as the free parameter, because it is just a bifurcation point. In a constant environment there is a unique stable equilibrium for one species following the "competitive exclusion" principle. In contrast, due to the oscillatory dynamics on the ecological time scale two species may coexist. That is, non-equilibrium dynamics enhances biodiversity. However, we will show that this coexistence is not stable on the evolutionary time scale and always one single species survives. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Despite a long history of the study of tropical forests, uncertainty about the importance of different ecological processes in shaping tropical tree species distributions persists. Trait- and phylogenetic-based tests of community assembly provide a powerful way to detect community assembly processes but have seldom been applied to the same community. Both methods are well suited to testing how the relative importance of different ecological processes changes with spatial scale. Here we apply both methods to the Yasun{\'\i} Forest Dynamics Plot, a 25-ha Amazonian forest with {\textgreater}1100 tree species. We found evidence for habitat filtering from both trait and phylogenetic methods from small (25 m2) to intermediate (10 000 m2) spatial scales. Trait-based methods detected even spacing of strategies, a pattern consistent with niche partitioning or enemy-mediated density dependence, at smaller spatial scales (25--400 m2). Simulation modeling of community assembly processes suggests that low statistical power to detect even spacing of traits at larger spatial scales may contribute to the observed patterns. Trait and phylogenetic methods tended to identify the same areas of the forest as being subject to habitat filtering. Phylogenetic community tests, which are far less data-intensive than trait-based methods, captured much of the same filtering patterns detected by trait-based methods but often failed to detect even-spacing patterns apparent in trait data. Taken together, it appears that both habitat associations and niche differentiation shape species co-occurrence patterns in one of the most diverse forests in the world at a range of small and intermediate spatial scales.},

	Abstract = {Research on the degree to which carbon (C) availability limits growth in trees, as well as recent trends in climate change and concurrent increases in drought-related tree mortality, have led to a renewed focus on the physiological mechanisms associated with tree growth responses to current and future climate. This has led to some dispute over the role of stored non-structural C compounds as indicators of a tree's current demands for photosynthate. Much of the uncertainty surrounding this issue could be resolved by developing a better understanding of the potential functions of non-structural C stored within trees. In addition to functioning as a buffer to reconcile temporal asynchrony between C demand and supply, the storage of non-structural C compounds may be under greater regulation than commonly recognized. We propose that in the face of environmental stochasticity, large, long-lived trees may require larger C investments in storage pools as safety margins than previously recognized, and that an important function of these pools may be to maintain hydraulic transport, particularly during episodes of severe stress. If so, survival and long-term growth in trees remain a function of C availability. Given that drought, freeze--thaw events and increasing tree height all impose additional constraints on vascular transport, the common trend of an increase in non-structural carbohydrate concentrations with tree size, drought or cold is consistent with our hypothesis. If the regulated maintenance of relatively large constitutive stored C pools in trees serves to maintain hydraulic integrity, then the minimum thresholds are expected to vary depending on the specific tissues, species, environment, growth form and habit. Much research is needed to elucidate the extent to which allocation of C to storage in trees is a passive vs. an active process, the specific functions of stored C pools, and the factors that drive active C allocation to storage.},

@article{ripley_consequences_2008,
	Abstract = {C(4) plants dominate the world's subtropical grasslands, but investigations of their ecology typically focus on climatic variation, ignoring correlated changes in soil nutrient concentration. The hypothesis that higher photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE) in C(4) than in C(3) species allows greater flexibility in the partitioning of growth, especially under nutrient-deficient conditions, is tested here. Our experiment applied three levels of N supply to the subtropical grass Alloteropsis semialata, a unique model system with C(3) and C(4) subspecies. Photosynthesis was significantly higher for the same investment of leaf N in the C(4) than C(3) subspecies, and was unaffected by N treatments. The C(4) plants produced more biomass than the C(3) plants at high N levels, diverting a greater fraction of growth into inflorescences and corms, but less into roots and leaves. However, N-limitation of biomass production caused size-dependent shifts in the partitioning of growth. Root production was higher in small than large plants, and associated with decreasing leaf biomass in the C(3), and inflorescence production in the C(4) plants. Higher PNUE in the C(4) than C(3) subspecies was therefore linked with greater investment in sexual reproduction and storage, and the avoidance of N-limitations on leaf growth, suggesting advantages of the C(4) pathway in disturbed and infertile ecosystems.},

@article{bond_what_2008,
	Abstract = {Though the distribution of global vegetation can generally be predicted from climate, grasslands are an exception. C4 grassy biomes cover vast areas that are warm enough and wet enough to support closed forests. The extent of this climate mismatch has been revealed by physiologically based global vegetation simulations and by large empirical data sets. Reasons for the existence of grassy biomes have long been debated, polarized into bottom-up (resources) or top-down (fire, herbivory) arguments. Recent studies indicate that both are important, especially in suppressing woody recruits. Grasses are formidable competitors belowground, create highly flammable fuels, and can support large herbivore densities. The net effect on trees is rare and episodic recruitment of adults in tree-fall gaps. The implication is that ecosystem structure and function depend on demographic transitions. Tree cover is increasing and grass/forest boundaries are changing. These changes can have large feedbacks to the earth-atmosphere system. Though progress has been made, there is still great uncertainty in predicting the future of C4 grassy biomes.},

We present a new model based on this framework that includes a multilayered physically based catchment water balance model and an ecophysiological gas exchange and photosynthesis model. The model uses optimization algorithms to find those static and dynamic vegetation properties that would maximize the net carbon profit under given environmental conditions. The model was tested at a savanna site near Howard Springs (Northern Territory, Australia) by comparing the modeled fluxes and vegetation properties with long-term observations at the site. The results suggest that optimality may be a useful way of approaching the prediction and estimation of vegetation cover, rooting depth, and fluxes such as transpiration and CO2 assimilation in ungauged basins without model calibration.},

For realistic values of the parameters the model behaves chaotically, but its dynamics within the strange attractor can be described by a few one-dimensional maps that allow one to forecast the next yearly peak of plankton or fish from the last peaks. This property is an unambiguous mark of a special form of chaos. Unfortunately, the estimate of such peak-to-peak maps from field data is possible only if plankton or young fish biomass has been sampled accurately and frequently for a paramount number of years. In conclusion, the analysis shows that it might be that plankton dynamics are characterized by an interesting and peculiar form of chaos, but that inferences from recorded data on the existence of these forms of chaos are premature.

A variety of evidence indicates that complex preferential patterns observed from fields are fractals. In this study, we developed a relatively simple active region model to incorporate the fractal flow pattern into the continuum approach. In the model, the flow domain is divided into active and inactive regions. Flow occurs preferentially in the active region (characterized by fractals), and inactive region is simply bypassed. A new constitutive relationship (the portion of the active region as a function of saturation) was derived. The validity of the proposed model is demonstrated by the consistency between field observations and the new constitutive relationship. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{mcnickle_plant_2009,
	Abstract = {All organisms must find and consume resources to live, and the strategies an organism uses when foraging can have significant impacts on their fitness. Models assuming optimality in foraging behavior, and which quantitatively account for the costs, benefits, and biological constraints of foraging, are common in the animal literature. Plant ecologists on the other hand have rarely adopted an explicit framework of optimality with respect to plant root foraging. Here, we show with a simple experiment that the marginal value theorem (MVT), one of the most classic models of animal foraging behavior, can provide novel insights into the root foraging behavior of plants. We also discuss existing data in the literature, which has not usually been linked to MVT to provide further support for the benefits of an optimal foraging framework for plants. As predicted by MVT, plants invest more time and effort into highly enriched patches than they do to low-enriched patches. On the basis of this congruency, and the recent calls for new directions in the plant foraging literature, we suggest plant ecologists should work toward a more explicit treatment of the idea of optimality in studies of plant root foraging. Such an approach is advantageous because it forces a quantitative treatment of the assumptions being made and the constraints on the system. While we believe significant insight can be gained from the use of preexisting models of animal foraging, ultimately plant ecologists will have to develop taxa-specific models that account for the unique biology of plants.},

@article{kulmatiski_woody_2013,
	Abstract = {Global circulation models and empirical evidence suggest that precipitation events are likely to become more extreme across much of the globe. As most plant roots are in shallow soils, small but pervasive changes in precipitation intensity could be expected to cause large-scale shifts in plant growth, yet experimental tests of the effects of precipitation intensity are lacking. Here we show that, without changing the total amount of precipitation, small experimental increases in precipitation intensity can push soil water deeper into the soil, increase aboveground woody plant growth and decrease aboveground grass growth in a savannah system. These responses seemed to reflect the ability of woody plants to increase their rooting depths and competitively suppress grass growth. In many parts of the world, woody plant abundance has multiplied in the past 50--100 years, causing changes in fire, forage value, biodiversity and carbon cycling. Factors such as fire, grazing and atmospheric CO2 concentrations have become dominant explanations for this woody encroachment and semi-arid structure in general. Our results suggest that niche partitioning is also an important factor in tree--grass coexistence and that the woody plant encroachment observed over the past century may continue in the future should precipitation intensity increase.},

@article{archibald_drivers_2009,
	Abstract = {Inter-annual variability in primary production and ecosystem respiration was explored using eddy-covariance data at a semi-arid savanna site in the Kruger Park, South Africa. New methods of extrapolating night-time respiration to the entire day and filling gaps in eddy-covariance data in semi-arid systems were developed. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) in these systems occurs as pulses associated with rainfall events, a pattern not well-represented in current standard gap-filling procedures developed primarily for temperate flux sites. They furthermore do not take into account the decrease in respiration at high soil temperatures. An artificial neural network (ANN) model incorporating these features predicted measured fluxes accurately (MAE 0.42 gC/m(2)/day), and was able to represent the seasonal patterns of photosynthesis and respiration at the site. The amount of green leaf area (indexed using satellite-derived estimates of fractional interception of photosynthetically active radiation fAPAR), and the timing and magnitude of rainfall events, were the two most important predictors used in the ANN model. These drivers were also identified by multiple linear regressions (MLR), with strong interactive effects. The annual integral of the filled NEE data was found to range from -138 to + 155 g C/m(2)/y over the 5 year eddy covariance measurement period. When applied to a 25 year time series of meteorological data, the ANN model predicts an annual mean NEE of 75(+/- 105) g C/m(2)/y. The main correlates of this inter-annual variability were found to be variation in the amount of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), length of the growing season, and number of days in the year when moisture was available in the soil.},

	Abstract = {When tropical and sub-tropical ecosystems burn, considerable amounts of N present in the biomass fuel may be released. This ultimately results in a loss of fixed N to the atmosphere. It is often assumed that this volatilization loss of N with frequent fire will result in a reduction of plant-available N and total system N. By changing the amount of woody biomass fire may, however, also have indirect effects on N and C dynamics. Here we consider the effects of 50 years of frequent fire on total soil N and soil organic C (SOC) and total soil N in a mesic savanna in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. We also determine how changes in woody biomass may affect total soil N and SOC. We measured soil and fine root N and C concentrations as well as total soil N and SOC pools in four burning treatments, including fire exclusion, of a long-term fire experiment. Our results show that regardless of soil depth, fire treatment had no significant effect on total soil N and SOC. Our results also show that under trees total soil N and SOC concentrations of the surface soil increase, and pools of N and SOC increase to a depth of 7 cm. However, the extent to which soil N and C dynamics differed under canopies and away from canopies was dependent on fire treatment. Our results show that the effect of fire on soil N and C is mediated both through the indirect effect of changes in woody cover and the direct effects of fire (volatilization losses of nutrients). We suggest that woody thickening in this mesic savanna will have pronounced effects on long-term N and C dynamics.},

@article{quade_expansion_1995,
	Abstract = {Stable-isotopic, clay-mineralogic, and bulk-chemical analyses were conducted on paleosols of the Neogene Siwalik sections in northern Pakistan in order to reconstruct floodplain environments over the past similar to 17 Ma. The stable carbon isotopic composition of soil carbonate (mean delta(13)C (PDB)=-10.2 parts per thousand) and associated organic matter (mean delta(13)C (PDB)=-24.1 parts per thousand) in paleosols representing 17-similar to 7.3 Ma reveal that floodplain vegetation was dominated by C-3 plants. At 7.3 Ma, a shift toward more positive carbon isotopic values began, signaling the gradual expansion of C-4 grasses onto the floodplain. From 6 Ma to present, carbon isotopic values for paleosol carbonate (mean delta(13)C (PDB)=+0.6 parts per thousand) and organic matter (mean delta(13)C (PDB)=-14.4 parts per thousand) are uniformly enriched in C-13, indicating the presence of nearly pure C-4 grassland. The scarcity of kaolinite and abundance of smectite and pedogenic carbonate in most paleosols suggest that rainfall in the region remained 1.0-1.25 m/yr or less for the entire 17 Ma of record. Paleosols in the lower portion of the section lack organic A horizons but have reddish B horizons often containing secondary iron-oxide nodules. Leaching depths of soil carbonate in these older paleosols are typically greater than those in the Plio-Pleistocene part of the section, where organic A horizons are common, and B horizons are markedly more yellow. The combined evidence suggests that the mature paleosols in the pre-7.3 Ma part of the record are dominantly calcareous Alfisols or Mollisols that once underlay nearly pure C-3 vegetation, perhaps trees and shrubs, while calcareous Mollisols underlying C-4 grassland dominate the upper part of the record. The carbon- and oxygen-isotopic trends in the paleosol record in Pakistan are also evident in the diet of fossil mammals, and in paleosols from Nepal, thus demonstrating that these paleoenvironmental changes in floodplain vegetation may be continent-wide. Local effects, such as the development or intensification of the Asian Monsoon driven by uplift of the Tibetan Plateau, may have led to the expansion of C-4 grasses. If, however, the expansion of C-4 grasses proves globally synchronous, then a larger scale cause, such as a marked decrease in pCO(2), may be the driving mechanism.},

However, ecosystems are managed and conserved for multiple functions, which may require greater biodiversity. Here we present an analysis of published data from grassland biodiversity experiments, and show that ecosystem multifunctionality does require greater numbers of species. We analysed each ecosystem function alone to identify species with desirable effects. We then calculated the number of species with positive effects for all possible combinations of functions. Our results show appreciable differences in the sets of species influencing different ecosystem functions, with average proportional overlap of about 0.2 to 0.5. Consequently, as more ecosystem processes were included in our analysis, more species were found to affect overall functioning. Specifically, for all of the analysed experiments, there was a positive saturating relationship between the number of ecosystem processes considered and the number of species influencing overall functioning. We conclude that because different species often influence different functions, studies focusing on individual processes in isolation will underestimate levels of biodiversity required to maintain multifunctional ecosystems.},

	Abstract = {The climates of Asia are affected significantly by the extent and height of the Himalayan mountains and the Tibetan plateau(1-4). Uplift of this region began about 50 Myr ago, and further significant increases in altitude of the Tibetan plateau are thought to have occurred about 10-8 Myr ago(4,5), or more recently. However, the climatic consequences of this uplift remain unclear. Here we use records of aeolian sediments from China(6,7) and marine sediments from the Indian(8-10) and North Pacific oceans(11) to identify three stages of evolution of Asian climates: first, enhanced aridity in the Asian interior and onset of the Indian and east Asian monsoons, about 9-8 Myr ago; next, continued intensification of the east Asian summer and winter monsoons, together with increased dust transport to the North Pacirc Ocean(11), about 3.6-2.6 Myr ago; and last, increased variability and possible weakening of the Indian and east Asian summer monsoons and continued strengthening of the east Asian winter monsoon since about 2.6 Myr ago. The results of a numerical climate-model experiment, using idealized stepwise increases of mountain-plateau elevation, support the argument that the stages in evolution of Asian monsoons are linked to phases of Himalaya-Tibetan plateau uplift and to Northern Hemisphere glaciation.},

@article{pillar_discriminating_2009,
	Abstract = {Whereas similar ecological requirements lead to trait-convergence assembly patterns (TCAP) of species in communities, the interactions controlling how species associate produce trait-divergence assembly patterns (TDAP). Yet, the linking of the latter to community processes has so far only been suggested. We offer a method to elucidate TCAP and TDAP in ecological community gradients that will help fill this gap. We evaluated the correlation between trait-based described communities and ecological gradients, and using partial correlation, we separated the fractions reflecting TCAP and TDAP. The required input data matrices describe operational taxonomic units (OTUs) by traits, communities by the quantities or presence-absence of these OTUs, and community sites by ecological variables. We defined plant functional types (PFTs) or species as community components after fuzzy weighting by the traits. The measured correlations for TCAP and TDAP were tested by permutation. The null model for TDAP preserves the trait convergence, the structure intrinsic in the fuzzy types, and community total abundances and autocorrelation. We applied the method to trait-based data from plant communities in south Brazil, one set in natural grassland experimental plots under different nitrogen and grazing levels, and another in sapling communities colonizing Araucaria forest patches of increasing size in a forest-grassland mosaic. In these cases, depending on the traits considered, we found strong evidence of either TCAP or TDAP, or both, that was related to the environmental gradients. The method developed is able to reveal TCAP and TDAP that are more likely to be functional for specified ecological gradients, allowing establishment of objective hypotheses on their links to community processes.},

@article{baker_increasing_2004,
	Abstract = {A previous study by Phillips et al. of changes in the biomass of permanent sample plots in Amazonian forests was used to infer the presence of a regional carbon sink. However, these results generated a vigorous debate about sampling and methodological issues. Therefore we present a new analysis of biomass change in old--growth Amazonian forest plots using updated inventory data. We find that across 59 sites, the above--ground dry biomass in trees that are more than 10 cm in diameter (AGB) has increased since plot establishment by 1.22 $\pm$ 0.43 Mg per hectare per year (ha−1 yr−1), where 1 ha = 104 m2), or 0.98 $\pm$ 0.38 Mg ha−1 yr−1 if individual plot values are weighted by the number of hectare years of monitoring. This significant increase is neither confounded by spatial or temporal variation in wood specific gravity, nor dependent on the allometric equation used to estimate AGB. The conclusion is also robust to uncertainty about diameter measurements for problematic trees: for 34 plots in western Amazon forests a significant increase in AGB is found even with a conservative assumption of zero growth for all trees where diameter measurements were made using optical methods and/or growth rates needed to be estimated following fieldwork. Overall, our results suggest a slightly greater rate of net stand--level change than was reported by Phillips et al. Considering the spatial and temporal scale of sampling and associated studies showing increases in forest growth and stem turnover, the results presented here suggest that the total biomass of these plots has on average increased and that there has been a regional--scale carbon sink in old--growth Amazonian forests during the previous two decades.},

By applying the Floquet theory of liner periodic impulsive equation, we show that there exists a globally asymptotically stable two-prey eradication periodic solution when the impulsive period is less than some critical value. Further, we prove that the system is permanent if the impulsive period is large than some critical value, and meanwhile the conditions for the extinction of one of the two prey and permanence of the remaining three species are given. Finally, numerical simulation shows that there exists a stable positive periodic solution with a maximum value no larger than a given level. Thus, we can use the stability of the positive periodic solution and its period to control insect pests at acceptably low levels. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {* Fire is a process that shapes the structure and composition of vegetation in many regions. Species in these regions have presumably evolved life-history strategies that allow success in fire-prone environments. * In this study, we examine the extent to which the ecological success of savanna trees is determined by traits that enhance the capacity to tolerate fire and/or traits indicative of an ecophysiological capacity for rapid growth. We define ecological success as the relative change in stem density over the course of a long-term (circa 40 year) fire experiment conducted in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. * We first examine the extent to which differences in the capacity of trees to tolerate fire can be explained by allometries describing bark traits and tree size. We then examine whether these differences in fire tolerance traits can explain observed shifts in abundance. * We show that species differ in their topkill responses (probability of above-ground mortality) and that these differences are explained in part by differences in bark moisture content and the allometry between height and diameter. Contrary to previous studies, we find no evidence that bark thickness is important in explaining susceptibility to topkill. * Synthesis. Fire tolerance traits did explain a significant component of the variance in observed shifts in the abundance of tree species. However, traits related to the carbon economy of photosynthesis were also important.},

	Abstract = {Plants with the C₄ photosynthetic pathway dominate today's tropical savannahs and grasslands, and account for some 30\% of global terrestrial carbon fixation. Their success stems from a physiological CO₂-concentrating pump, which leads to high photosynthetic efficiency in warm climates and low atmospheric CO₂ concentrations. Remarkably, their dominance of tropical environments was achieved in only the past 10 million years (Myr), less than 3\% of the time that terrestrial plants have existed on Earth. We critically review the proposal that declining atmospheric CO₂ triggered this tropical revolution via its effects on the photosynthetic efficiency of leaves. Our synthesis of the latest geological evidence from South Asia and North America suggests that this emphasis is misplaced. Instead, we find important roles for regional climate change and fire in South Asia, but no obvious environmental trigger for C-4 success in North America. CO2-starvation is implicated in the origins Of C-4 plants 25-32 Myr ago, raising the possibility that the pathway evolved under more extreme atmospheric conditions experienced 10 times earlier. However, our geochemical analyses provide no evidence of the C-4 mechanism at this time, although possible ancestral components of the C-4 pathway are identified in ancient plant lineages. We suggest that future research must redress the substantial imbalance between experimental investigations and analyses of the geological record.},

Home range size, or the area used by individual organisms, is a critical ecological variable that integrates behaviour, physiology and population density and strongly depends on organism size(5-7). Here we present a new model of home range-body size scaling based on fractal resource distributions, in which resource encounter rates are a function of body size. The model predicts no universally constant scaling exponent for home range, but defines a possible range of values set by geometric limits to resource density and distribution. The model unifies apparently conflicting earlier results and explains differences in scaling exponents among herbivorous and carnivorous mammals and birds(5-18). We apply the model to predict that home range increases with habitat fragmentation, and that the home ranges of larger species should be much more sensitive to habitat fragmentation than those of smaller species.},

	Abstract = {Functional diversity (FD) is a key facet of biodiversity used to address central questions in ecology. Despite recent methodological advances, FD remains a complex concept and no consensus has been reached either on how to quantify it, or on how it influences ecological processes. Here we define FD as the distribution of trait values within a community. When and how to account for intraspecific trait variability (ITV) when measuring FD remains one of the main current debates. It remains however unclear to what extent accounting for population-level ITV would modify FD quantification and associated conclusions. In this paper, we address two critical questions: (1) How sensitive are different components of FD to the inclusion of population-level ITV? (2) Does the omission of ITV obscure the understanding of ecological patterns? Using a mixture of empirical data and simulation experiments, we conducted a sensitivity analysis of four commonly used FD indices (community weighted mean traits, functional richness, Rao's quadratic entropy, Petchey and Gaston's FD index) and their relationships with environmental gradients and species richness, by varying both the extent (plasticity or not) and the structure (contingency to environmental gradient due to local adaptation) of population-level ITV. Our results suggest that ITV may strongly alter the quantification of FD and the detection of ecological patterns. Our analysis highlights that 1) species trait values distributions within communities are crucial to the sensitivity to ITV, 2) ITV structure plays a major role in this sensitivity and 3) different indices are not evenly sensitive to ITV, the single-trait FD from Petchey and Gaston being the most sensitive among the four metrics tested. We conclude that the effects of intraspecific variability in trait values should be more systematically tested before drawing central conclusions on FD, and suggest the use of simulation studies for such sensitivity analyses.},

We then explain when stochasticity matters in evolution, distinguishing four broad situations: stochasticity contributes to maladaptation or limits adaptation; it drives evolution on flat fitness landscapes (evolutionary freedom); it might promote jumps from one fitness peak to another (evolutionary revolutions); and it might shape the selection pressures themselves. We show that stochasticity, by directly steering evolution, has become an essential ingredient of evolutionary theory beyond the classical Wright-Fisher or neutralist-selectionist debates.},

	Abstract = {Regional variability and seasonal courses of atmospheric CO2 provide important clues to the understanding of the carbon exchange fluxes which determine the global carbon budget. We apply the Frankfurt Biosphere Model (FBM) to all 32 vegetation types of a modified global Matthews' vegetation map, simulating seasonal carbon exchange fluxes of the terrestrial ecosystems and their geographical variability on a global scale. For each 0.5 degrees by 0.5 degrees grid element the model calculates gross photosynthesis of the canopy and autotrophic respiration on an hourly time step, and heterotrophic respiration as well as the model-compartment sizes and LAI (leaf area index) on a daily time step. The driving variables temperature, irradiation, and soil moisture are derived from the Cramer and Leemans database. Soil moisture is calculated by an improved bucket model in which the soil properties given by the FAO soil map are combined with the rooting depth of different vegetation types to deduce the available water capacity and the permanent wilting point. Based on mean estimates of ecological variables [e.g. net primary production (NPP), biomass and soil carbon] and a characteristic seasonal climate, the free parameters of each vegetation type are calibrated. With these parameters, taking the climate variation within the vegetation types into account, the seasonal courses of NPP are calculated, summing up to a global annual integral of 50.3 Gt C yr(-1). The results are presented in the form of a world map showing the annual NPP and a table with monthly values of NPP averaged over 5 degrees latitude belts. The latter results are graphically displayed not only for NPP but also for heterotrophic respiration and the resulting seasonal net ecosystem production. Since the FBM keeps track of the seasonal development of leaf biomass, the corresponding seasonal LAI is examined for each grid element. The calculated leaf emergence dales are in good agreement with observations from phenological gardens as well as with NDVI (normalized difference vegitation index) derived phenology.},

	Abstract = {Ecosystem engineers are organisms that directly or indirectly modulate the availability of resources to other species, by causing physical state changes in biotic or abiotic materials. In so doing they modify, maintain and create habitats. Autogenic engineers (e.g. corals, or trees) change the environment via their own physical structures (i.e. their living and dead tissues). Allogenic engineers (e.g. woodpeckers, beavers) change the environment by transforming living or non-living materials from one physical state to another, via mechanical or other means. The direct provision of resources to other species, in the form of living or dead tissues is not engineering. Organisms act as engineers when they modulate the supply of a resource or resources other than themselves. We recognise and define five types of engineering and provide examples. Humans are allogenic engineers par excellence, and also mimic the behaviour of autogenic engineers, for example by constructing glasshouses. We explore related concepts including the notions of extended phenotypes and keystone species. Some (but not all) products of ecosystem engineering are extended phenotypes. Many (perhaps most) impacts of keystone species include not only trophic effects, but also engineers and engineering. Engineers differ in their impacts. The biggest effects are attributable to species with large per capita impacts, living at high densities, over large areas for a long time, giving rise to structures that persist for millennia and that modulate many resource flows (e.g. mima mounds created by fossorial rodents). The ephemeral nests constructed by small, passerine birds lie at the opposite end of this continuum. We provide a tentative research agenda for an exploration of the phenomenon of organisms as ecosystem engineers, and suggest that all habitats on earth support, and are influenced by, ecosystem engineers.},

	Abstract = {Nitrogen (N) limits the productivity of many ecosystems worldwide, thereby restricting the ability of terrestrial ecosystems to offset the effects of rising atmospheric CO(2) emissions naturally(1,2). Understanding input pathways of bioavailable N is therefore paramount for predicting carbon (C) storage on land, particularly in temperate and boreal forests(3,4). Paradigms of nutrient cycling and limitation posit that new N enters terrestrial ecosystems solely from the atmosphere. Here we show that bedrock comprises a hitherto overlooked source of ecologically available N to forests. We report that the N content of soils and forest foliage on N-rich metasedimentary rocks (350-950 mg N kg(-1)) is elevated by more than 50\% compared with similar temperate forest sites underlain by N-poor igneous parent material (30-70 mg N kg(-1)). Natural abundance N isotopes attribute this difference to rock-derived N: (15)N/(14)N values for rock, soils and plants are indistinguishable in sites underlain by N-rich lithology, in marked contrast to sites on N-poor substrates. Furthermore, forests associated with N-rich parent material contain on average 42\% more carbon in above-ground tree biomass and 60\% more carbon in the upper 30 cm of the soil than similar sites underlain by N-poor rocks.

	Abstract = {To improve the understanding of consequences of climate change for annual plant communities, I used a detailed, grid-based model that simulates the effect of daily rainfall variability on individual plants in five climatic regions on a gradient from 100 to 800 mm mean annual precipitation (MAP). The model explicitly considers moisture storage in the soil. I manipulated daily rainfall variability by changing the daily mean rain (DMR, rain volume on rainy days averaged across years for each day of the year) by $\pm$ 20\%. At the same time I adjusted intervals appropriately between rainy days for keeping the mean annual volume constant. In factorial combination with changing DMR I also changed MAP by $\pm$ 20\%.

@article{richardson_human-mediated_2011,
	Abstract = {Aim Australian acacias (1012 recognized species native to Australia, which were previously grouped in Acacia subgenus Phyllodineae) have been moved extensively around the world by humans over the past 250 years. This has created the opportunity to explore how evolutionary, ecological, historical and sociological factors interact to affect the distribution, usage, invasiveness and perceptions of a globally important group of plants. This editorial provides the background for the 20 papers in this special issue of Diversity and Distributions that focusses on the global cross-disciplinary experiment of introduced Australian acacias. Location Australia and global. Methods The papers of the special issue are discussed in the context of a unified framework for biological invasions. Distributions of species were mapped across Australia, their representation in bioclimatic zones examined and the potential global distribution of the group modelled. By collating a variety of different lists, we determined which Australian acacias have reached different stages in the introduction-naturalization-invasion continuum in different parts of the world. Paradigms and key research questions relating to barriers to invasion, stages of invasion and management perceptions are sketched. Results According to our global database of Australian acacia records, 386 species have been moved outside Australia by human agency, 71 species are naturalized or weedy, and 23 are unequivocally invasive. Climatic models suggest that about a third of the world's land surface is climatically suitable for Australian acacias. Many species are commercially important crops or are useful for other purposes and have been extensively planted, and many different human perceptions of Australian acacias exist in different parts of the world. The papers in the special issue cover all the barriers, stages and processes that define biological invasions and touch on many aspects: history and the human dimension; aspects of the species pool; species traits; biotic interactions; climate and niche; and management. Main conclusions Australian acacias are an excellent model group for examining interactions between evolutionary, ecological and socio-economic drivers of species introductions. New insights have emerged on the biological, ecological and evolutionary correlates of naturalization and invasion, but human usage factors permeate all explanatory models. Understanding and managing introduced Australian acacias requires a fundamental and integrative appreciation of both intrinsic (e.g. species traits) and extrinsic (e.g. human usage and perceptions) aspects.},

@article{furley_savanna_2008,
	Abstract = {Long-term fire experiments in savannnas are rare, given the difficulties and demands of operation. Controlled fire experiments date from colonial times in West Africa, although the largest and best-known is located in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. The achievements of these experiments are assessed from examples in Africa, South America and Australia. A less well-known experiment in Zimbabwe was sited at the Marondera Grassland Research Station and ran from 1953 to 1991. Some of the preliminary results on the impact of fire on vegetation are analysed and compared with further vegetation surveys in 2007. Studies on tree growth in this miombo savanna woodland indicate that the plots burned at three- and four-year intervals recovered to,greater mean heights than the unburned control plots. There was no significant variation between treatments, suggesting that the few trees that did survive in the frequently burned plots were large specimens. Brachystegia and Julbernadia dominated the plots throughout and after the experiment. Basal area and stocking density were highest in the four-yearly burned plots but there was a high variability throughout the experiment, suggesting that many trees may have attained heights and bark thicknesses sufficient to protect from fire damage. Fire also affected the composition of the herbaceous plant community, but not the number of species. By the end of the experiment some grass and sedge species had flourished while others revealed greater susceptibility to fire, and fire-tolerant species predominated in the most frequently burned areas. The experimental design appeared to cope well with the variability between plots and indicated the soundness of the initial design and its implementation.},

@article{johns_second_1997,
	Abstract = {This study describes a new coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model (OAGCM) developed for studies of climate change and results from a hindcast experiment. The model includes various physical and technical improvements relative to an earlier version of the Hadley Centre OAGCM. A coupled spinup process is used to bring the model to equilibrium. Compared to uncoupled spinup methods this is computationally more expensive, but helps to counter climate drift arising from inadequate sampling of short time scale coupled variability when the components are equilibrated separately. Including sea ice advection and enhancing reference surface salinities in high southern latitudes in austral winter to promote bottom water formation during spinup appears to have stabilized the high-latitude drift exhibited in the earlier model's control run. In the present study, the atmospheric control climate is stable on multi-century time scales with a drift in global average surface air temperature of only +0.016 K/century, despite a small residual drift in the deep ocean. The control climate is an improvement over the earlier model in several respects, notably in its variability on short time scales. Two anomaly runs are presented incorporating estimated forcing changes over the period 1860 to 1990 arising from greenhouse gases alone and from greenhouse gases plus the radiative scattering effect of sulphate aerosols. These allow validation of the model against the instrumental climate record. Inclusion of aerosol forcing gives a significantly better simulation of historical temperature patterns, although comparisons against recent sea ice trends are equivocal. These studies emphasize the potential importance of including additional forcing terms apart from greenhouse gases in climate simulations, and refining estimates of their spatial distribution and magnitude.},

* Here, carbon (C) flux predictions of five terrestrial biosphere models (Community Land Model version 3.5 (CLM3.5), Ecosystem Demography model version 2.1 (ED2), Integrated BIosphere Simulator version 2.6.4 (IBIS), Joint UK Land Environment Simulator version 2.1 (JULES) and Simple Biosphere model version 3 (SiB3)) and a hydrodynamic terrestrial ecosystem model (the Soil--Plant--Atmosphere (SPA) model) were evaluated against measurements from two large-scale Amazon drought experiments.


* Model predictions agreed with the observed C fluxes in the control plots of both experiments, but poorly replicated the responses to the drought treatments. Most notably, with the exception of ED2, the models predicted negligible reductions in aboveground biomass in response to the drought treatments, which was in contrast to an observed c. 20\% reduction at both sites. For ED2, the timing of the decline in aboveground biomass was accurate, but the magnitude was too high for one site and too low for the other.


* Three key findings indicate critical areas for future research and model development. First, the models predicted declines in autotrophic respiration under prolonged drought in contrast to measured increases at one of the sites. Secondly, models lacking a phenological response to drought introduced bias in the sensitivity of canopy productivity and respiration to drought. Thirdly, the phenomenological water-stress functions used by the terrestrial biosphere models to represent the effects of soil moisture on stomatal conductance yielded unrealistic diurnal and seasonal responses to drought.},

	Abstract = {At high temperatures and relatively low CO(2) concentrations, plants can most efficiently fix carbon to form carbohydrates through C(4) photosynthesis rather than through the ancestral and more widespread C(3) pathway. Because most C(4) plants are grasses, studies of the origin of C(4) are intimately tied to studies of the origin of the grasses. We present here a phylogeny of the grass family, based on nuclear and chloroplast genes, and calibrated with six fossils. We find that the earliest origins of C(4) likely occurred about 32 million years ago (Ma) in the Oligocene, coinciding with a reduction in global CO(2) levels. After the initial appearance of C(4) species, photosynthetic pathway changed at least 15 more times; we estimate nine total origins of C(4) from C(3) ancestors, at least two changes of C(4) subtype, and five reversals to C(3). We find a cluster of C(4) to C(3) reversals in the Early Miocene correlating with a drop in global temperatures, and a subsequent cluster of C(4) origins in the Mid-Miocene, correlating with the rise in temperature at the Mid-Miocene climatic optimum. In the process of dating the origins of C(4), we were also able to provide estimated times for other major events in grass evolution. We find that the common ancestor of the grasses (the crown node) originated in the upper Cretaceous. The common ancestor of maize and rice lived at 52 +/- 8 Ma.},

	Abstract = {This paper uses five inter-related topics (the management of rivers, fire regimes, invasive alien species, rare antelope and elephants) to assess 15 years of adaptive management in the Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa. The importance of adaptive planning (a process for developing achievable objectives, which is adaptive because objectives are revised as understanding grows), has been highlighted by this assessment, and the KNP's track record of adaptive planning is better than that of adaptive management. Adaptive management has identified important issues with regard to biodiversity conservation, and resulted in a shift in management focus to these issues. Because the conservation outcomes of management shifts will only manifest themselves in the longer term, the relative success of adaptive management should be measured by the degree to which management has been refocused onto priority issues, and by the rate at which new understanding is generated. Some issues previously seen as important (fire, rare antelope), are now regarded as less so, while others remain important and difficult to solve, although there has been some progress (rivers, alien plants and elephants). It has also proved difficult to implement active adaptive management (large-scale, replicated trials using different approaches), because of local variation and logistical problems. Adaptive management will remain the approach of choice because there is some progress, and no known alternative to managing this complex ecosystem. It is simply not an option to return to the easily-understood "implementable" solutions (such as culling, regular prescribed burning, or artificial water provision) that demonstrably did not work.

@article{gunderson_ecological_2000,
	Abstract = {In 1973, C. S. Holling introduced the word resilience into the ecological literature as a way of helping to understand the non-linear dynamics observed in ecosystems. Ecological resilience was defined as the amount of disturbance that an ecosystem could withstand without changing self-organized processes and structures (defined as alternative stable states). Other authors consider resilience as a return time to a stable state following a perturbation. A new term, adaptive capacity, is introduced to describe the processes that modify ecological resilience. Two definitions recognize the presence of multiple stable states (or stability domains), and hence resilience is the property that mediates transition among these states. Transitions among stable states have been described for many ecosystems, including semi-arid rangelands, lakes, coral reefs, and forests. In these systems, ecological resilience is maintained by keystone structuring processes across a number of scales, sources of renewal and reformation, and functional biodiversity. In practice, maintaining a capacity for renewal in a dynamic environment provides an ecological buffer that protects the system from the failure of management actions that are taken based upon incomplete understanding, and it allows managers to affordably learn and change.},

This hypothesis relies on vertical niche partitioning and assumed that grasses are more water-use efficient than trees and use subsurface water while trees also have access to deeper water sources. Thus, in open savannas, grasses were predicted to predominate because of their water use efficiency and access to subsurface water. This hypothesis has been a prominent part of the savanna literature since first proposed. We review the literature on Walter's hypothesis and reconsider his original intentions. Walter intended this hypothesis to be restricted to dry savannas. In his opinion, mesic and humid savannas were controlled by biotic factors and disturbances. We surveyed the global savanna literature for records of vertical niche partitioning by grasses and trees. We find that, within the scope of Walter's original intentions, this hypothesis works remarkably well, and in some cases is appropriate for deserts as well as for dry temperate systems and even some mesic savannas.},

* *Freeze--thaw-induced loss in hydraulic conductivity was studied in relation to xylem anatomy, leaf- and sapwood-specific hydraulic conductivity and gas exchange characteristics of leaves.
* *We found evidence that a trade-off between xylem transport capacity and safety from freeze--thaw-induced embolism affects photosynthetic activity in overwintering evergreens. The mean hydraulically weighted xylem vessel diameter and sapwood-specific conductivity correlated with susceptibility to freeze--thaw-induced embolism. There was also a strong correlation of hydraulic supply and demand across species; interspecific differences in stomatal conductance and CO2 assimilation rates were correlated linearly with sapwood- and leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity.

	Abstract = {Long-term population effects of changes in atmospheric CO2 will be largely determined by reproductive effort. Our research objectives were to quantify variability in seed production and rate of maturation among individual Pinus taeda L. (Pinaceae) trees growing in elevated CO2 (ambient plus 200 mu L L-1) since 1996. Estimating tree fecundity in nature is frustrated by the difficulty of counting seeds from individual trees and the need for long-term data. We have used a hierarchical Bayes approach to model individual tree fecundity, accounting for the complexity of experimentation in a natural setting over multiple years. The study presented here demonstrates large variability in natural fecundity rates and contributes to our understanding of how both interannual variation and population heterogeneity influence elevated CO2 effects. We found that trees growing under elevated CO2 matured earlier and produced more seeds and cones per unit basal area than ambient grown trees. By 2004, trees grown in high CO2 had produced an average 300 more seeds per tree than ambient grown trees. Although there was a trend toward decreasing mean CO2 effect (difference in fecundity between elevated and ambient treatments) over time, the hierarchical analysis indicates that this decrease comes from the emergence of a few highly fecund ambient grown trees by 2002, rather than acclimation or downregulation among the fumigated trees. The most important effect of increased CO2 in forest ecosystems may be the increase in fecundity reported here. Although biomass responses can sometimes be large, the increase in fecundity can have long-term impacts on forest dynamics that transcend the current generation.},

@article{iwasa_tree_1985,
	Abstract = {Games between trees are studied to explain the height and the crown shape in a community. It is assumed that each tree maximizes the net productivity under the light environment, which is determined by surrounding trees. In both models, the asymmetry of competition is important, because higher leaves shade lower leaves but the lower don't shade the higher. In the tree-height game, each tree is assumed to choose a height given its crown shape. The height at a monomorphic equilibrium, in which all the trees of a community have the same height, increases with the tree density and the amount of leaves per tree, but decreases with the cost coefficient and the crown thickness. When the crown is thin enough, a polymorphic equilibrium appears, in which a community includes trees of different heights but with the same fitness. In the crown-shape game, each tree is assumed to choose the distribution of foliage along the height axis. A lone tree should have a hemispherical crown as the optimum. The monomorphic equilibrium in which all the trees in a community have the same crown shape is calculated. As the tree density increases, the average height of a crown of each tree increases and the height on the tree with the maximum foliage increases, but each tree should have some foliage all the way down to the ground. Several reasons for foliage cutoff at the lowest layer are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Climate is a potent selective force in natural populations, yet the importance of adaptation in the response of plant species to past climate change has been questioned. As many species are unlikely to migrate fast enough to track the rapidly changing climate of the future, adaptation must play an increasingly important role in their response. In this paper we review recent work that has documented climate-related genetic diversity within populations or on the microgeographical scale. We then describe studies that have looked at the potential evolutionary responses of plant populations to future climate change. We argue that in fragmented landscapes, rapid climate change has the potential to overwhelm the capacity for adaptation in many plant populations and dramatically alter their genetic composition. The consequences are likely to include unpredictable changes in the presence and abundance of species within communities and a reduction in their ability to resist and recover from further environmental perturbations, such as pest and disease outbreaks and extreme climatic events. Overall, a range-wide increase in extinction risk is likely to result. We call for further research into understanding the causes and consequences of the maintenance and loss of climate-related genetic diversity within populations.},

	Abstract = {Biodiversity is essential to the viability of ecological systems. Species diversity in ecosystems is promoted by cyclic, non-hierarchical interactions among competing populations. Central features of such non-transitive relations are represented by the 'rock-paper-scissors' game, in which rock crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper wraps rock. In combination with spatial dispersal of static populations, this type of competition results in the stable coexistence of all species and the long-term maintenance of biodiversity(1-5). However, population mobility is a central feature of real ecosystems: animals migrate, bacteria run and tumble. Here, we observe a critical influence of mobility on species diversity. When mobility exceeds a certain value, biodiversity is jeopardized and lost. In contrast, below this critical threshold all subpopulations coexist and an entanglement of travelling spiral waves forms in the course of time. We establish that this phenomenon is robust; it does not depend on the details of cyclic competition or spatial environment. These findings have important implications for maintenance and temporal development of ecological systems and are relevant for the formation and propagation of patterns in microbial populations or excitable media.},

	Abstract = {HIGH-FREQUENCY climate variability is a fundamental aspect of climate. Understanding climate change demands attention to changes in climate variability and extremes(1), but knowledge of the recent behaviour of these variables has been limited by the unavailability of long-term high-resolution data. Climate simulations incorporating increased greenhouse-gas concentrations(2-9) indicate that a warmer climate could result in a decrease in high-frequency temperature variability (analogous to the decrease in variability observed from the poles to the tropics, and from winter to summer(10)) and an increase in the proportion of precipitation occurring in extreme events. Here we analyse high-frequency temperature and precipitation data from hundreds of sites spread over Australia, China, the former Soviet Union and the United States over the past 30 to 80 years. Day-to-day temperature variability is seen to have decreased in the Northern Hemisphere, and-at least within the United States-the proportion of total precipitation contributed by extreme, one-day events has increased significantly. We find that although the notion of a recent increase in interannual temperature variability is supported by data from the past few decades(11), the longer data records indicate that this trend is an aberration.},

	Abstract = {Both the form of functional relationships applied for soil water properties and the natural field-scale variability of such properties can significantly impact simulation of the soil-plant-atmosphere system on a diurnal timescale. Various input parameters for soil water properties including effective saturation, residual water content, anerobiosis point, field capacity, and permanent wilting point are incorporated into functions describing soil water retention, hydraulic conductivity, diffusivity, sorptivity, and the plant sink function. The perception of the meaning of these values and their variation within a natural environment often differs from the perspective of the soil physicist, plant physiologist, and atmospheric scientist. This article investigates the sensitivity of energy balance and boundary layer simulation to different soil water property functions using the Oregon State University coupled atmosphere-plant-soil (CAPS) simulation model under bare soil conditions. The soil parameterizations tested in the CAPS model include those of Clapp and Hornberger [1978], van Genuchten [1980], and Cosby et al. [1984] using initial atmospheric conditions from June 16, 1986 in Hydrologic Atmospheric Pilot Experiment-Mod{\'e}lisation du Bilan Hydrique (HAPEX-MOBILHY). For the bare soil case these results demonstrate unexpected model sensitivity to soil water property parameterization in partitioning all components of the diurnal energy balance and corresponding boundary layer development.},

@article{baxter_model-framed_2005,
	Abstract = {There is a concern that high densities of elephants in southern Africa could lead to the overall reduction of other forms of biodiversity. We present a grid-based model of elephant-savanna dynamics, which differs from previous elephant-vegetation models by accounting for woody plant demographics, tree-grass interactions, stochastic environmental variables (fire and rainfall), and spatial contagion of fire and tree recruitment. The model projects changes in height structure and spatial pattern of trees over periods of centuries. The vegetation component of the model produces long-term tree-grass coexistence, and the emergent fire frequencies match those reported for southern African savannas. Including elephants in the savanna model had the expected effect of reducing woody plant cover, mainly via increased adult tree mortality, although at an elephant density of 1.0 elephant/km(2), woody plants still persisted for over a century. We tested three different scenarios in addition to our default assumptions. (1) Reducing mortality of adult trees after elephant use, mimicking a more browsing-tolerant tree species, mitigated the detrimental effect of elephants on the woody population. (2) Coupling germination success (increased seedling recruitment) to elephant browsing further increased tree persistence, and (3) a faster growing woody component allowed some woody plant persistence for at least a century at a density of 3 elephants/km(2). Quantitative models of the kind presented here provide a valuable tool for exploring the consequences of management decisions involving the manipulation of elephant population densities.},

	Abstract = {The endemic conifer species Araucaria laubenfelsii forms a characteristic component of the various forest and non-forest vegetation assemblages present on Mont Do, New Caledonia. It is the only tree species in the landscape to be found in both maquis (shrubland) and forest patches. Adult density ranges from zero in some parts of the maquis to extremely high in others, forming an Araucaria woodland. The current landscape structure on Mont Do appears to be the result of recurrent disturbance, especially by fire. However, it is uncertain whether this structure is the result of recent changes in the fire regime (as a result of Melanesian and European phases of human colonisation of New Caledonia) and is therefore transient. or represents a more stable formation. A spatially explicit grid-based model was developed to explore some of these issues. The model is primarily concerned with understanding how alterations to the disturbance regime (past and future) may influence the landscape structure and, in particular. whether the current landscape pattern is a result or increased fire frequencies over the last century and whether certain unusual vegetation assemblages in the landscape, such as maquis with emergent Araucaria, are likely to persist in the long-term. The ecological context of the spatial landscape model is described as is a simple sensitivity analysis of the model and an example of its use under 'baseline' conditions.

	Abstract = {Abstract The construction of a 0.5$\,^{\circ}$ lat × 0.5$\,^{\circ}$ long surface climatology of global land areas, excluding Antarctica, is described. The climatology represents the period 1961--90 and comprises a suite of nine variables: precipitation, wet-day frequency, mean temperature, diurnal temperature range, vapor pressure, sunshine, cloud cover, ground frost frequency, and wind speed. The climate surfaces have been constructed from a new dataset of station 1961--90 climatological normals, numbering between 19 800 (precipitation) and 3615 (wind speed). The station data were interpolated as a function of latitude, longitude, and elevation using thin-plate splines. The accuracy of the interpolations are assessed using cross validation and by comparison with other climatologies. This new climatology represents an advance over earlier published global terrestrial climatologies in that it is strictly constrained to the period 1961--90, describes an extended suite of surface climate variables, explicitly incorporates elevation as a predictor variable, and contains an evaluation of regional errors associated with this and other commonly used climatologies. The climatology is already being used by researchers in the areas of ecosystem modelling, climate model evaluation, and climate change impact assessment.

We used a high-resolution 130,000-year environmental record to help resolve the cause and reconstruct the ecological consequences of extinction of Australia's megafauna. Our results suggest that human arrival rather than climate caused megafaunal extinction, which then triggered replacement of mixed rainforest by sclerophyll vegetation through a combination of direct effects on vegetation of relaxed herbivore pressure and increased fire in the landscape. This ecosystem shift was as large as any effect of climate change over the last glacial cycle, and indicates the magnitude of changes that may have followed megafaunal extinction elsewhere in the world.},

In a tropical mountain rain forest in southern Ecuador, we measured the apparent diurnal gas exchange of stems and coarse roots (diameter 1-4 cm) of trees from representative families along an elevational transect with plots at 1050, 1890 and 3050 m a.s.l. Mean air temperatures were 20.8, 17.2 and 10.6 degrees C, respectively. Stem and root CO(2) efflux of 13 to 21 trees per stand from dominant families were investigated with an open gas exchange system while stand microclimate was continuously monitored. Substantial variation in respiratory activity among and within species was found at all sites. Mean daily CO(2) release rates from stems declined 6.6-fold from 1.38 micromol m(-2) s(-1) at 1050 m to 0.21 micromol m(-2) s(-1) at 3050 m. Mean daily CO(2) release from coarse roots decreased from 0.35 to 0.20 micromol m(-2) s(-1) with altitude, but the differences were not significant. There was, thus, a remarkable shift from a high ratio of stem to coarse root respiration rates at the lowest elevation to an apparent equivalence of stem and coarse root CO(2) efflux rates at the highest elevation. We conclude that stem respiration, but not root respiration, greatly decreases with elevation in this transect, coinciding with a substantial decrease in relative stem diameter increment and a large increase in fine and coarse root biomass production with elevation.},

For the mid-Holocene, the coupled model simulated a northward shift of savanna up to 20 degrees N into the Sahara which in turn amplified the response of the atmospheric circulation to changes in the Earth's orbit during the Holocene. Moreover, in the simulation, most of the western part of the Sahara appeared to be vegetated by xerophytic woods/shrub and warm grass, while the eastern part remained a desert.

In particular, photons cannot be mixed by vigorous stirring, so that phototrophic organisms experience the light-limited chemostat as a heterogeneous environment.

	Abstract = {Human ability to manipulate fire and the landscape has increased over evolutionary time, but the impact of this on fire regimes and consequences for biodiversity and biogeochemistry are hotly debated. Reconstructing historical changes in human-derived fire regimes empirically is challenging, but information is available on the timing of key human innovations and on current human impacts on fire; here we incorporate this knowledge into a spatially explicit fire propagation model. We explore how changes in population density, the ability to create fire, and the expansion of agropastoralism altered the extent and seasonal distribution of fire as modern humans arose and spread through Africa. Much emphasis has been placed on the positive effect of population density on ignition frequency, but our model suggests this is less important than changes in fire spread and connectivity that would have occurred as humans learned to light fires in the dry season and to transform the landscape through grazing and cultivation. Different landscapes show different limitations; we show that substantial human impacts on burned area would only have started similar to 4,000 B.P. in open landscapes, whereas they could have altered fire regimes in closed/dissected landscapes by similar to 40,000 B.P. Dry season fires have been the norm for the past 200-300 ky across all landscapes. The annual area burned in Africa probably peaked between 4 and 40 kya. These results agree with recent paleocarbon studies that suggest that the biomass burned today is less than in the recent past in subtropical countries.},

@article{esser_feedback_2011,
	Abstract = {The efforts to explain the 'missing sink' for anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) have included in recent years the role of nitrogen as an important constraint for biospheric carbon fluxes. We used the Nitrogen Carbon Interaction Model (NCIM) to investigate patterns of carbon and nitrogen storage in different compartments of the terrestrial biosphere as a consequence of a rising atmospheric CO2 concentration, in combination with varying levels of nitrogen availability. This model has separate but closely coupled carbon and nitrogen cycles with a focus on soil processes and soil-plant interactions, including an active compartment of soil microorganisms decomposing litter residues and competing with plants for available nitrogen. Biological nitrogen fixation is represented as a function of vegetation nitrogen demand. The model was validated against several global datasets of soil and vegetation carbon and nitrogen pools. Five model experiments were carried out for the modeling periods 1860-2002 and 2002-2100. In these experiments we varied the nitrogen availability using different combinations of biological nitrogen fixation, denitrification, leaching of soluble nitrogen compounds with constant or rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Oversupply with nitrogen, in an experiment with nitrogen fixation, but no nitrogen losses, together with constant atmospheric CO2, led to some carbon sequestration in organismic pools, which was nearly compensated by losses of C from soil organic carbon pools. Rising atmospheric CO2 always led to carbon sequestration in the biosphere. Considering an open nitrogen cycle including dynamic nitrogen fixation, and nitrogen losses from denitrification and leaching, the carbon sequestration in the biosphere is of a magnitude comparable to current observation based estimates of the 'missing sink.' A fertilization feedback between the carbon and nitrogen cycles occurred in this experiment, which was much stronger than the sum of separate influences of high nitrogen supply and rising atmospheric CO2. The demand-driven biological nitrogen fixation was mainly responsible for this result. For the modeling period 2002-2100, NCIM predicts continued carbon sequestration in the low range of previously published estimates, combined with a plausible rate of CO2-driven biological nitrogen fixation and substantial redistribution of nitrogen from soil to plant pools.},

Various approaches to modeling have been developed to enable us to understand spatial patterns ranging from plant distributions to plankton aggregation. We present a new approach to modeling spatial interactions by deriving approximations for the time evolution of the moments (mean and spatial covariance) of ensembles of distributions of organisms; the analysis is made possible by "moment closure," neglecting higher-order spatial structure in the population. We use the growth and competition of plants in an explicitly spatial environment as a starting point for exploring the properties of second-order moment equations and comparing them to realizations of spatial stochastic models. We find that for a wide range of effective neighborhood sizes (each plant interacting with several to dozens of neighbors), the mean-covariance model provides a useful and analytically tractable approximation to the stochastic spatial model. and combines useful features of stochastic models and traditional reaction-diffusion-like models.

	Abstract = {* The growing literature on the phylogenetic structure of plant communities places great emphasis on the role of phylogenetic niche conservatism (PNC) in community assembly. However, the patterns revealed by such analyses are difficult to interpret in the absence of independent data on niche structure. While there is increasing evidence that plant coexistence does depend upon niche differences, it is still not clear in most cases what the relevant niche axes are. * We address this problem by testing for PNC within the African Restionaceae (`restios'), a clade endemic to the Western Cape where we have shown niche segregation along soil moisture gradients to be common. * Significant niche segregation on soil moisture gradients occurred among restios in 7 of 10 communities sampled, but PNC was detectable in only one of these and then only by one of three methods used. * Phylogenetic analysis of the evolution of hydrological niche traits for the species pool of 37 Restionaceae in the study showed tolerance of drought to be convergent rather than conserved. * Synthesis. The demonstration that clear niche segregation may occur among related species without PNC being detectable supports the hypothesis that hydrological niche responses are evolutionarily labile. More generally, the results demonstrate that phylogenetic analysis can be a poor guide to the process of community assembly. We argue that it may in future be better to apply ecological data to the interpretation of phylogenies, rather than to follow the current preoccupation with the application of phylogenies to ecology.},

	Abstract = {A classification of spatial simulation models of fire and vegetation dynamics (landscape fire succession models or LFSMs) is presented. The classification was developed to provide a foundation for comparing models and to help identify the appropriate fire and vegetation processes and their simulation to include in coarse scale dynamic global vegetation models. Other uses include a decision tool for research and management applications and a vehicle to interpret differences between LFSMs. The classification is based on the four primary processes that influence fire and vegetation dynamics: fire ignition, fire spread, fire effects, and vegetation succession. Forty-four LFSMs that explicitly simulated the four processes were rated by the authors and the modelers on a scale from 0 to 10 for their inherent degree of stochasticity, complexity, and mechanism for each of the four processes. These ratings were then used to group LFSMs into similar classes using common ordination and clustering techniques. Another database was created to describe each LFSM using selected keywords for over 20 explanatory categories. This database and the ordination and clustering results were then used to create the final LFSM classification that contains 12 classes and a corresponding key. The database and analysis results were used to construct a second classification key so managers can pick the most appropriate model for their application based on computer resources, available modeling expertise, and management objective.

@article{valeix_behavioral_2009,
	Abstract = {Predators may influence their prey populations not only through direct lethal effects, but also through indirect behavioral changes. Here, we combined spatiotemporal fine-scale data from GPS radio collars on lions with habitat use information on 11 African herbivores in Hwange National Park (Zimbabwe) to test whether the risk of predation by lions influenced the distribution of herbivores in the landscape. Effects of long-term risk of predation (likelihood of lion presence calculated over four months) and short-term risk of predation (actual presence of lions in the vicinity in the preceding 24 hours) were contrasted. The long-term risk of predation by lions appeared to influence the distributions of all browsers across the landscape, but not of grazers. This result strongly suggests that browsers and grazers, which face different ecological constraints, are influenced at different spatial and temporal scales in the variation of the risk of predation by lions. The results also show that all herbivores tend to use more open habitats preferentially when lions are in their vicinity, probably an effective anti-predator behavior against such an ambush predator. Behaviorally induced effects of lions may therefore contribute significantly to structuring African herbivore communities, and hence possibly their effects on savanna ecosystems.},

@article{chesson_interaction_2008,
	Abstract = {Competition and predation are the most heavily investigated species interactions in ecology, dominating studies of species diversity maintenance. However, these two interactions are most commonly viewed highly asymmetrically. Competition for resources is seen as the primary interaction limiting diversity, with predation modifying what competition does(1), although theoretical models have long supported diverse views(1-5). Here we show, using a comprehensive three- trophic- level model, that competition and predation should be viewed symmetrically: these two interactions are equally able to either limit or promote diversity. Diversity maintenance requires within- species density feedback loops to be stronger than between- species feedback loops. We quantify the contributions of predation and competition to these loops in a simple, interpretable form, showing their equivalent potential to strengthen or weaken diversity maintenance. Moreover, we show that competition and predation can undermine each other, with the tendency of the stronger interaction to promote or limit diversity prevailing. The past failure to appreciate the symmetrical effects and interactions of competition and predation has unduly restricted diversity maintenance studies. A multitrophic perspective should be adopted to examine a greater variety of possible effects of predation than generally considered in the past. Conservation and management strategies need to be much more concerned with the implications of changes in the strengths of trophic interactions.},

@article{wang_droughts_2011,
	Abstract = {Hydraulic redistribution (HR), the nocturnal transport of moisture by plant roots from wetter to drier portions of the root zone, in general can buffer plants against seasonal water deficits. However, its role in longer droughts and its long-term ecological impact are not well understood. Based on numerical model experiments for the Amazon forest, this modeling study indicates that the impact of HR on plant growth differs between droughts of different time scales. While HR increases transpiration and plant growth during regular dry seasons, it reduces dry season transpiration and net primary productivity (NPP) under extreme droughts such as those during El Ni{\~n}o years in the Amazon forest. This occurs because, in places where soil water storage is not able to sustain the ecosystem through the dry season, the HR-induced acceleration of moisture depletion in the early stage of the dry season reduces water availability for the rest of the dry season and causes soil moisture to reach the wilting point earlier. This gets exacerbated during extreme droughts, which jeopardizes the growth of trees that are not in dry season dormancy, i.e., evergreen trees. As a result, the combination of drought and HR increases the percentage of drought deciduous trees at the expense of evergreen trees, and the fractional coverage of forest canopy is characterized by sudden drops following extreme droughts and slow recovery afterwards. The shift of the tropical forest towards more drought deciduous trees as a result of the combined effects of extreme drought and HR has important implications for how vegetation will respond to future climate changes.},

@article{leuschner_large_2007,
	Abstract = {Tropical rain forests decrease in tree height and aboveground biomass (AGB) with increasing elevation. The causes of this phenomenon remain insufficiently understood despite a number of explanations proposed including direct or indirect effects of low temperature on carbon acquisition and carbon investment, adverse soil conditions and impaired nutrient supply. For analysing altitudinal patterns of aboveground/belowground carbon partitioning, we measured fine ({\textless}2mm in diameter) and coarse root (2-5mm) biomass and necromass and leaf area index (LAI), and estimated AGB, from stand structural parameters in five tropical mountain rain forests at 1050, 1540, 1890, 2380 and 3060 m along an altitudinal transect in the South Ecuadorian Andes. Average tree height and AGB were reduced to less than 50\% between 1050 and 3060 m, LAI decreased from 5.1 to 2.9. The leaf area reduction must have resulted in a lowered canopy carbon gain and thus may partly explain the reduced tree growth in the high-elevation stands. In contrast, both fine and coarse root biomass significantly increased with elevation across this transect. The ratio of root biomass (fine and coarse) to AGB increased more than ten-fold from 0.04 at 1050 m to 0.43 at 3060 m. Under the assumption that fine root biomass does reflect root productivity, our data indicate a marked belowground shift in C allocation with increasing elevation. Possible explanations for this allocation shift are discussed including reduced N supply due to low temperatures, water logging or adverse soil chemical. conditions. We conclude that the fine root system and its activity may hold the key for understanding the impressive reduction in tree size along tropical mountain slopes in Ecuador. Analyses of fine root turnover and longevity in relation to environmental factors along altitudinal transects in tropical mountains are urgently needed. (C) 2006 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

	Abstract = {Both positive and negative interactions among species are common in communities. Until recently, attention has focused on negative interactions such as competition. However, the importance of positive interactions such as the Allee effect has recently been recognized. We construct a single-patch model that incorporates both an Allee effect and competition between two species. A species that experiences an Allee effect cannot establish in a patch which is already occupied by a competitor unless its density is over a critical value. This effect, when translated into a metapopulation, makes migrants of a species unable to colonize patches where another species has established. This interaction between the Allee effect and inter-specific competition creates and stabilizes spatial segregation of species. Therefore, under circumstances in which competition would preclude local coexistence, the presence of an Allee effect can allow coexistence at a metapopulation scale. Furthermore, we found that a species can resist displacement if stronger competitors experience an Allee effect. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {During the past several decades, observational data have shown a faster increase in hot temperature extremes than the change in mean temperature. Increasingly high extreme temperatures are expected to affect terrestrial ecosystem function. The ecological impact of hot extremes on vegetation production, however, remains uncertain across biomes in natural climatic conditions. In this study, we investigated the effects of hot temperature extremes on vegetation production by combining the MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data set and in situ climatic records during the period 2000 to 2009 from 12 long-term experimental sites across biomes and climate. Our results show that higher mean annual maximum temperatures (Tmax) greatly reduced grassland production, and yet enhanced forest production after removing the effect of precipitation. The relative decrease in vegetation production was 16\% for arid grassland and 7\% for mesic grassland, and the increase was 5\% for forest. We also observed a significantly positive relationship between interannual aboveground net primary production (ANPP) and Tmax for the forest biome (R2 = 0.79, P {\textless} 0.001). This line of evidence suggests that hot temperature extremes lead to contrasting ecosystem-level responses of vegetation production between grassland and forest biomes. Given that many terrestrial ecosystem models use average daily temperature as input, predictions of ecosystem production should consider such contrasting responses to increasingly hot temperature extreme regimes associated with climate change.},

@article{silva_plant_2011,
	Abstract = {An essential characteristic of savannas is the presence of two main plant functional types: grasses and trees. The tree-grass coexistence in savannas is expected robe stabilised either deterministically by water availability or by occurrences of fire and herbivory. However, under a neutral macroevolutionaiy perspective, functional types could arise purely as a consequence of branching processes in plant lineages. We sought plant functional types in cerrado by assessing 360 species and 11 functional traits that correspond to important dimensions of the niche of plants. Then, we tested whether random branching processes in plant lineages could generate the observed plant functional types. We sought functional types with the k-means partitioning analysis. We constructed a phylogenetic tree for all species sampled and tested whether the phylogeny could be generated by one of the branching processes that can randomly produce functional types: (1) pure birth, (2) rate-constant birth-death, and (3) rate-variable birth-death models. Then, we compared the functional types we observed with a multivariate analysis of variance in a phylogenetic context. Two major functional types characterised the cerrado plant community - one type dominated by grasses and herbaceous shrubs and other by woody shrubs and trees. These functional types were different from the functional types simulated under Brownian motion of evolution of traits. Thus, underlying adaptive processes rather than random evolutionary processes accounted for the plant functional types. The herbaceous and woody functional types seem to have appeared as a consequence of adaptive processes of plants to cope mainly with water availability, fire, and herbivory. However, the niche partition between herbaceous and woody species supports that the reduction in the competitive interactions may be also important to the stable coexistence between trees and grass in savannas.

@article{smeets_bottom-up_2007,
	Abstract = {In this article, a model for estimating bioenergy production potentials in 2050, called the Quickscan model, is presented. In addition, a review of existing studies is carried out, using results from the Quickscan model as a starting point. The Quickscan model uses a bottom-up approach and its development is based on an evaluation of data and studies on relevant factors such as population growth, per capita food consumption and the efficiency of food production. Three types of biomass energy sources are included: dedicated bioenergy crops, agricultural and forestry residues and waste, and forest growth. The bioenergy potential in a region is limited by various factors, such as the demand for food, industrial roundwood, traditional woodfuel, and the need to maintain existing forests for the protection of biodiversity. Special attention is given to the technical potential to reduce the area of land needed for food production by increasing the efficiency of food production. Thus, only the surplus area of agricultural land is included as a source for bioenergy crop production. A reference scenario was composed to analyze the demand for food. Four levels of advancement of agricultural technology in the year 2050 were assumed that vary with respect to the efficiency of food production. Results indicated that the application of very efficient agricultural systems combined with the geographic optimization of land use pattems could reduce the area of land needed to cover the global food demand in 2050 by as much as 72\% of the present area. A key factor was the area of land suitable for crop production, but that is presently used for permanent grazing. Another key factor is the efficiency of the production of animal products. The bioenergy potential on surplus agricultural land (i.e. land not needed for the production of food and feed) equaled 215-1272 EJ yr(-1), depending on the level of advancement of agricultural technology. The bulk of this potential is found in South America and Caribbean (4-221 EJ yr(-1)), sub-Saharan Africa (31-317 EJ yr(-1)) and the C.I.S. and Baltic States (45-199 EJ yr(-1)). Also Oceania and North America had considerable potentials: 20-174 and 38-102 EJ yr, respectively. However, realization of these (technical) potentials requires significant increases in the efficiency of food production, whereby the most robust potential is found in the C.I.S. and Baltic States and East Europe. Existing scenario studies indicated that such increases in productivity may be unrealistically high, although these studies generally excluded the impact of large scale biocnergy crop production. The global potential of bioenergy production from agricultural and forestry residues and wastes was calculated to be 76-96 EJ yr(-1) in the year 2050. The potential of bioenergy production from surplus forest growth (forest growth not required for the production of industrial roundwood and traditional woodfuel) was calculated to be 74 EJyr(-1) in the year 2050.

After greenhouse gases, sulphate aerosols probably exert the next largest anthropogenic radiative forcing of the atmosphere(3), but their influence on global mean warming has not been assessed using such models, Here me use a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model to simulate past and future climate since the beginning of the near-global instrumental surface-temperature record(4), and include the effects of the scattering of radiation by sulphate aerosols, The inclusion of sulphate aerosols significantly improves the agreement with observed global mean and large-scale patterns of temperature in recent decades, although the improvement in simulations of specific regions is equivocal, We predict a future global mean warming of 0.3 K per decade for greenhouse gases alone, or 0.2 K per decade with sulphate aerosol forcing included, By 2050, all land areas have warmed in our simulations, despite strong negative radiative forcing in some regions. These model results suggest that global warming could accelerate as greenhouse-gas forcing begins to dominate over sulphate aerosol forcing.},

	Abstract = {Impact of Future Climate and Land Use Change on Non-timber Forest Product Provision in Benin, West Africa: Linking Niche-based Modeling with Ecosystem Service Values. Non-timber forest products (NTFPs) make a major contribution to the livelihoods of the West African population. However, these ecosystem services are threatened by climate and land use change. Our study aims at 1) the quantification and monetary mapping of important NTFPs, and 2) developing a novel approach to assess the impacts of climate and land use change on the economic benefits derived from these NTFPs. We performed household interviews in northern Benin to gather data on annual quantities of collected NTFPs from the three most important savanna tree species: Adansonia digitata, Parkia biglobosa, and Vitellaria paradoxa. Current market prices of the NTFPs were derived from local markets. We assessed the species' current and future (2050) occurrence probabilities by calibrating niche-based models with climate and land use data at a 0.1$\,^{\circ}$ resolution (cell: {\textasciitilde}10 × 10 km). To assess future economic gains and losses, respectively, we linked modeled species' occurrence probabilities with the spatially assigned monetary values. Highest current annual benefits are obtained from V. paradoxa (USD 54,111 $\pm$ 28,126/cell), followed by P. biglobosa (USD 32,246 $\pm$ 16,526/cell) and A. digitata (USD 9,514 $\pm$ 6,243/cell). The future simulations showed spatially varying impacts of environmental change. In particular A. digitata might benefit in some regions. However, large areas are projected to lose up to 50 \% of their current economic value by 2050 with regard to the three species. Our findings provide a first benchmark for local policy-makers to economically compare different land use options and adjust existing management strategies.},

	Abstract = {Terrestrial ecosystems gain carbon through photosynthesis and lose it mostly in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2). The extent to which the biosphere can act as a buffer against rising atmospheric CO2 concentration in global climate change projections remains uncertain at the present stage(1-4). Biogeochemical theory predicts that soil nitrogen (N) scarcity may limit natural ecosystem response to elevated CO2 concentration, diminishing the CO2-fertilization effect on terrestrial plant productivity in unmanaged ecosystems(3-7). Recent models have incorporated such carbon-nitrogen interactions and suggest that anthropogenic N sources could help sustain the future CO2-fertilization effect(8,9). However, conclusive demonstration that added N enhances plant productivity in response to CO2-fertilization in natural ecosystems remains elusive. Here we manipulated atmospheric CO2 concentration and soil N availability in a herbaceous brackish wetland where plant community composition is dominated by a C-3 sedge and C-4 grasses, and is capable of responding rapidly to environmental change(10). We found that N addition enhanced the CO2-stimulation of plant productivity in the first year of a multi-year experiment, indicating N-limitation of the CO2 response. But we also found that N addition strongly promotes the encroachment of C-4 plant species that respond less strongly to elevated CO2 concentrations. Overall, we found that the observed shift in the plant community composition ultimately suppresses the CO2-stimulation of plant productivity by the third and fourth years. Although extensive research has shown that global change factors such as elevated CO2 concentrations and N pollution affect plant species differently(11-13), and that they may drive plant community changes(14-17), we demonstrate that plant community shifts can act as a feedback effect that alters the whole ecosystem response to elevated CO2 concentrations. Moreover, we suggest that trade-offs between the abilities of plant taxa to respond positively to different perturbations may constrain natural ecosystem response to global change.},

Resolution of this issue has been hindered by difficulty in quantifying the fraction of woody cover in the fossil record. Here we show that the fraction of woody cover in tropical ecosystems can be quantified using stable carbon isotopes in soils. Furthermore, we use fossil soils from hominin sites in the Awash and Omo-Turkana basins in eastern Africa to reconstruct the fraction of woody cover since the Late Miocene epoch (about 7 million years ago). (13)C/(12)C ratio data from 1,300 palaeosols at or adjacent to hominin sites dating to at least 6 million years ago show that woody cover was predominantly less than similar to 40\% at most sites. These data point to the prevalence of open environments at the majority of hominin fossil sites in eastern Africa over the past 6 million years.},

The tendency for species to retain their ancestral ecology has been demonstrated in distributions on local and regional scales5, 6, 7, but the extent of ecological conservatism over tens of millions of years and across continents has not been assessed8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Here we show that biome stasis at speciation has outweighed biome shifts by a ratio of more than 25:1, by inferring ancestral biomes for an ecologically diverse sample of more than 11,000 plant species from around the Southern Hemisphere. Stasis was also prevalent in transocean colonizations. Availability of a suitable biome could have substantially influenced which lineages establish on more than one landmass, in addition to the influence of the rarity of the dispersal events themselves. Conversely, the taxonomic composition of biomes has probably been strongly influenced by the rarity of species' transitions between biomes. This study has implications for the future because if clades have inherently limited capacity to shift biomes13, then their evolutionary potential could be strongly compromised by biome contraction as climate changes.},

	Abstract = {Flowering time is a critical life history trait, one that is shaped by evolution to maximize fecundity, reproductive success and fitness (Amasino ). This is especially true of annual plants where the cycle of floral initiation, pollination and seed production occur at regular intervals to ensure the survival of the species. In long-lived perennials, however, flowering can be an intermittent phenomenon and thus a challenge to understand. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Kobayashi et al. () tackle this particular challenge by applying modern-day molecular techniques to the `spectacular and mysterious' mass flowering that takes places in mixed dipterocarp forests of South-East Asia. Here, amidst an almost unimaginable diversity of forbs, shrubs and trees, these authors used next-generation sequencing technology to characterize what they refer to as the `ecological transcriptome' in an attempt to glimpse into the functional genomic reprogramming of Shorea beccariana at pre- and postflowering developmental transitions. They encountered many of the challenges that are often underappreciated yet typical for tropical ecological research including sample collection within a {\textasciitilde}40-m high tree canopy, unpredictable flowering intervals and determining the most appropriate preflowering state for sampling. Despite these challenges, the authors were able to integrate gene ontology relationships with gene-clustering algorithms and environmental data to support the hypothesis that drought is a key trigger for flowering in S. beccariana. The cloning and transgenic expression of selected S. beccariana genes to corroborate presumed protein function is a key feature of their work and seldom applied within an ecological framework. As illustrated by Kobayashi et al. (), the inclusion of molecular biology, genomics and bioinformatics has the potential to shed light on long-standing questions of ecological concern.},

	Abstract = {Experimental evidence demonstrates a higher efficiency of water and nitrogen use in C(4) compared with C(3) plants, which is hypothesized to drive differences in biomass allocation between C(3) and C(4) species. However, recent work shows that contrasts between C(3) and C(4) grasses may be misinterpreted without phylogenetic control. Here, we compared leaf physiology and growth in multiple lineages of C(3) and C(4) grasses sampled from a monophyletic clade, and asked the following question: which ecophysiological traits differ consistently between photosynthetic types, and which vary among lineages? C(4) species had lower stomatal conductance and water potential deficits, and higher water-use efficiency than C(3) species. Photosynthesis and nitrogen-use efficiency were also greater in C(4) species, varying markedly between clades. Contrary to previous studies, leaf nitrogen concentration was similar in C(4) and C(3) types. Canopy mass and area were greater, and root mass smaller, in the tribe Paniceae than in most other lineages. The size of this phylogenetic effect on biomass partitioning was greater in the C(4) NADP-me species than in species of other types. Our results show that the phylogenetic diversity underlying C(4) photosynthesis is critical to understanding its functional consequences. Phylogenetic bias is therefore a crucial factor to be considered when comparing the ecophysiology of C(3) and C(4) species.},

@article{vahl_spatial_2005,
	Abstract = {In studying the success of foraging animals, studies of interference competition have put emphasis on effects of competitor density, whereas studies of resource defense have focused on the effects of the spatial distribution of food within patches. Very few studies have looked at both factors simultaneously, that is, determined whether the effects of competitor density on foraging success depend on the spatial distribution of food. We studied the behavior and the foraging success of ruddy turnstones (Arenaria interpres) using an experiment in which we varied both the presence of a competitor and the food distribution. Because turnstones may differ strongly in their relative dominance status, we also experimentally varied the foragers' relative dominance status. We found that the presence of a competitor only reduced the foraging success of subordinate birds foraging at the clumped food distribution. At this condition, dominant and subordinate birds differed markedly in their foraging success. Contrary to our expectations, we did not observe more agonistic behavior at the clumped food distribution. This indicates that the amount of agonistic behavior observed may be a bad indicator of interference effects. These findings have specific implications for models of interference competition. Most notably they show that the effects of competitor density on agonistic behavior and foraging success may well depend on the spatial distribution of food and the foragers' relative dominance status. Additionally, our results suggest that social dominance will not be fully understood without considering long-term processes such as the formation and maintenance of social dominance hierarchies.},

Summary

Extensive within-canopy light gradients importantly affect the photosynthetic productivity of leaves in different canopy positions and lead to light-dependent increases in foliage photosynthetic capacity per area (AA). However, the controls on AA variations by changes in underlying traits are poorly known. We constructed an unprecedented worldwide database including 831 within-canopy gradients with standardized light estimates for 304 species belonging to major vascular plant functional types, and analyzed within-canopy variations in 12 key foliage structural, chemical and physiological traits by quantitative separation of the contributions of different traits to photosynthetic acclimation. Although the light-dependent increase in AA is surprisingly similar in different plant functional types, they differ fundamentally in the share of the controls on AA by constituent traits. Species with high rates of canopy development and leaf turnover, exhibiting highly dynamic light environments, actively change AA by nitrogen reallocation among and partitioning within leaves. By contrast, species with slow leaf turnover exhibit a passive AA acclimation response, primarily determined by the acclimation of leaf structure to growth light. This review emphasizes that different combinations of traits are responsible for within-canopy photosynthetic acclimation in different plant functional types, and solves an old enigma of the role of mass- vs area-based traits in vegetation acclimation.},

We captured seven female elephants, representative members of family groups, in different parts of Tarangire National Park (TNP), Tanzania, and used GPS satellite radio-tracking (November 1997-June 2000) to monitor their space and habitat use and seasonal migrations throughout wet and dry seasons. Patterns of home range overlap revealed the existence of two Large clans that occupied the north-central and southern parts of TNP, respectively. At the end of the dry season, elephants from the southern clan migrated about 100 km southeast of the park boundary, those from the northern clan remained mostly inside the park, or used periodically wet-season core areas in the nearby Game Controlled Areas. No natural mortality occurred during the study, but two elephants were poached outside the park. Human disturbance also affected activity patterns, and elephants were Less active at day outside than inside the park. Home range size varied from 477 to 1078 km(2) for the northern elephants, and from 1630 to 5060 km(2) for the southern elephants. Migration routes were characterised by higher cover (open and closed forest) than core areas. Our results indicate that elephant management must be considered across park boundaries and that migration corridors must be protected against human disturbance and land cultivation. Society problems Linked to elephant conservation can be solved by creating alternative, sustainable, use of natural resources that enhance the livelihood of Local communities.

	Abstract = {Four common agroforestry trees, including both exotic and native species, were used to provide a range of leafing phenologies to test the hypothesis that temporal complementarity between trees and crops reduces competition for water in agroforestry systems during the cropping period and improves utilisation of annual rainfall. Species examined included Melia volkensii, which sheds its leaves twice a year, Senna spectabilis and Gliricidia sepium, which shed their leaves once during the long dry season, and the evergreen Croton megalocarpus. Phenological patterns were examined in relation to climatic conditions in the bimodal rainfall regions of Kenya to identify factors which dictate the intensity of competition between trees and crops. The main differences in leaf cover patterns were between indigenous and exotic tree species. The Central American species, S. spectabilis and G. sepium, shed their foliage during the dry season before the short rains, whereas the native species, M. volkensii and C. megalocarpus, exhibited reduced leaf cover during both dry seasons. C. megalocarpus was the only species to maintain leaf cover throughout the 2-year experimental period. M. volkensii and S. spectabilis exhibited similar leafing phenology, losing almost all leaf cover during the long dry season (July-October) and flushing before the onset of the ensuing rains. S. spectabilis lost few leaves during the short dry season, whereas M. volkensii shed a greater proportion of its foliage before flushing prior to the long rains (March-July). M. volkensii lost much of its leaf cover during the 1997/1998 short rains (October-February), when soil water content was unusually high. Although essentially evergreen, leaf cover in C. megalocarpus decreased during the dry season and increased rapidly during periods of high rainfall. G. sepium exhibited a period of low leaf cover during the long dry season and did not regain full leaf cover until mid-way through the short rains. The mechanisms responsible for these phenological changes and the implications of tree phenology for resource utilisation and competition with crops are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

	Abstract = {Adaptation does not necessarily lead to traits which are optimal for the population. This is because selection is often the strongest at the individual or gene level. The evolution of selfishness can lead to a `tragedy of the commons', where traits such as aggression or social cheating reduce population size and may lead to extinction. This suggests that species-level selection will result whenever species differ in the incentive to be selfish. We explore this idea in a simple model that combines individual-level selection with ecology in two interacting species. Our model is not influenced by kin or trait-group selection. We find that individual selection in combination with competitive exclusion greatly increases the likelihood that selfish species go extinct. A simple example of this would be a vertebrate species that invests heavily into squabbles over breeding sites, which is then excluded by a species that invests more into direct reproduction. A multispecies simulation shows that these extinctions result in communities containing species that are much less selfish. Our results suggest that species-level selection and community dynamics play an important role in regulating the intensity of conflicts in natural populations.},

We tested this idea by examining the interspecific relationships between R d measured at a standard temperature and leaf life-span, N, SLA and A max for 69 species from four functional groups (forbs, broad-leafed trees and shrubs, and needle-leafed conifers) in six biomes traversing the Americas: alpine tundra/subalpine forest, Colorado; cold temperate forest/grassland, Wisconsin; cool temperate forest, North Carolina; desert/shrubland, New Mexico; subtropical forest, South Carolina; and tropical rain forest, Amazonas, Venezuela. Area-based R d was positively related to area-based leaf N within functional groups and for all species pooled, but not when comparing among species within any site. At all sites, mass-based R d (R d-mass) decreased sharply with increasing leaf life-span and was positively related to SLA and mass-based A max and leaf N (leaf N mass). These intra-biome relationships were similar in shape and slope among sites, where in each case we compared species belonging to different plant functional groups. Significant R d-mass−N mass relationships were observed in all functional groups (pooled across sites), but the relationships differed, with higher R d at any given leaf N in functional groups (such as forbs) with higher SLA and shorter leaf life-span. Regardless of biome or functional group, R d-mass was well predicted by all combinations of leaf life-span, N mass and/or SLA (r 2≥ 0.79, P {\textless} 0.0001). At any given SLA, R d-mass rises with increasing N mass and/or decreasing leaf life-span; and at any level of N mass, R d-mass rises with increasing SLA and/or decreasing leaf life-span. The relationships between R d and leaf traits observed in this study support the idea of a global set of predictable interrelationships between key leaf morphological, chemical and metabolic traits.},

@article{wang_hierarchical_2009,
	Abstract = {The increasing complexity of ecosystem models represents a major difficulty in tuning model parameters and analyzing simulated results. To address this problem, this study develops a hierarchical scheme that simplifies the Biome-BGC model into three functionally cascaded tiers and analyzes them sequentially. The first-tier model focuses on leaf-level ecophysiological processes; it simulates evapotranspiration and photosynthesis with prescribed leaf area index (LAI). The restriction on LAI is then lifted in the following two model tiers, which analyze how carbon and nitrogen is cycled at the whole-plant level (the second tier) and in all litter/soil pools (the third tier) to dynamically support the prescribed canopy. in particular, this study analyzes the steady state of these two model tiers by a set of equilibrium equations that are derived from Biome-BGC algorithms and are based on the principle of mass balance. Instead of spinning-up the model for thousands of climate years, these equations are able to estimate carbon/nitrogen stocks and fluxes of the target (steady-state) ecosystem directly from the results obtained by the first-tier model. The model hierarchy is examined with model experiments at four AmeriFlux sites. The results indicate that the proposed scheme can effectively calibrate Biome-BCC to simulate observed fluxes of evapotranspiration and photosynthesis; and the carbon/nitrogen stocks estimated by the equilibrium analysis approach are highly consistent with the results of model simulations. Therefore, the scheme developed in this study may serve as a practical guide to calibrate/analyze Biome-BGC; it also provides an efficient way to solve the problem of model spin-up, especially for applications over large regions. The same methodology may help analyze other similar ecosystem models as well. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Light-saturated assimilation rate (A(mass)), leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf density, thickness, life span, saturated water content, chlorophyll, nitrogen and phosphorus content were determined during the wet season for 21 tree species in four contrasting habitats in northern Australia. Rainfall in this area is extremely seasonal. 3. A(mass) and foliar chlorophyll, N and P contents were positively correlated with each other, and were all negatively correlated with LMA, leaf thickness, density and life span. 4. Deciduous species had smaller LMA and leaf life span, and larger foliar N and P contents than did evergreen species. 5. The eight Myrtaceous species had smaller A(mass), foliar chlorophyll, N and P contents, and larger LMA, leaf thickness and leaf life span than did the non-Myrtaceous species. 6. Leaves from the closed canopy dry monsoon forest had significantly larger A(mass), chlorophyll and P contents than did leaves from the three open canopy habitats (eucalypt open forest, mixed woodland and Melaleuca swamp). This reflected the relatively low proportions of evergreen and Myrtaceous species in the dry monsoon forest. There were also significant intraspecific differences among habitats. 7. Leaf thickness, density and LMA were lower than predicted from globally derived relationships with temperature and precipitation. Tropical seasonally dry biomes are under-represented in such global analyses.},

	Abstract = {Elasticity is a perturbation measure in matrix projection models that quantifies the proportional change in population growth rate as a function of a proportional change in a demographic transition (growth, survival, reproduction, etc.). Elasticities thus indicate the relative "importance" of life cycle transitions for population growth and maintenance. In this paper. we discuss the applications of elasticity analysis, and its extension, loop analysis, in life history studies and conservation, Elasticity can be interpreted as the relative contribution of a demographic parameter to population growth rate. Loop analysis reveals the underlying pathway structure of the life cycle graph. The different kinds of results of the two analyses in studies of life histories are emphasized. Because elasticities quantify the relative importance of life cycle transitions to population growth rate, it is generally inferred that management should focus on the transitions with the largest elasticities. Such predictions based on elasticities seem robust, but we do identify three situations where problems may arise. The mathematical properties and biological constraints that underlie these pitfalls are explained. Examples illustrate the additional information that needs to be taken into account for a sensible use of elasticities in population management. We conclude by indicating topics that are in need of research.},

	Abstract = {The introduced gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) is a principal threat to the populations of the red squirrel (S. vulgaris). We used a spatially explicit population dynamics model to investigate the changes of red and gray squirrel populations in landscapes to assess the effects of gray squirrel population control methods on red squirrel population viability. We analyzed 2 methods of gray squirrel population control: (1) trapping where adults were killed on an annual basis, and (2) immunocontraception where reproduction was suppressed. The model was run under a range of efficiency and intensity of control as well as red and gray squirrel life-history scenarios created by Latin Hypercube Sampling of the realistic parameter range for both demographic and control variables. The viability of squirrel populations in 2 contrasting landscape scenarios was investigated: (1) Thetford Forest, East Anglia, United Kingdom (UK), where a small isolated population of red squirrels is surrounded by a large population of gray squirrels; and (2) Redesdale Forest, Northumberland, UK, where red squirrels are still in abundance and the first gray squirrels were observed to disperse into the area from Scotland. In the absence of population control of gray squirrels, red squirrel populations were predicted to become extinct in both landscapes within 15 years at Thetford and 6 years at Redesdale. Immunocontraception did not lead to persistent populations at Thetford but allowed red squirrels to persist in Redesdale. Removal of gray squirrels by trapping at both sites was predicted to lead to red squirrel population persistence. Our findings suggest that immunocontraception is unlikely to be effective unless it is applied to a large portion of the target and surrounding population. Our results also indicate that an integrated control strategy, incorporating both trapping and immunocontraception, may be the best option for controlling gray squirrels. This integrated strategy needs to include the relative costs of control, and it may be that immunocontraception provides the best overall solution in areas where gray squirrels are low in abundance.},

Recent reports suggest that a strong correlation exists between warming and advances in spring phenology but that a weaker correlation is evident between warming and autumnal events implying that other factors may be influencing the timing of autumnal phenology. Using freely rooted, field-grown Populus in two Free Air CO2 Enrichment Experiments (AspenFACE and PopFACE), we present evidence from two continents and over 2 years that increasing atmospheric CO2 acts directly to delay autumnal leaf coloration and leaf fall. In an atmosphere enriched in CO2 (by similar to 45\% of the current atmospheric concentration to 550 ppm) the end of season decline in canopy normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)a commonly used global index for vegetation greennesswas significantly delayed, indicating a greener autumnal canopy, relative to that in ambient CO2. This was supported by a significant delay in the decline of autumnal canopy leaf area index in elevated as compared with ambient CO2, and a significantly smaller decline in end of season leaf chlorophyll content. Leaf level photosynthetic activity and carbon uptake in elevated CO2 during the senescence period was also enhanced compared with ambient CO2. The findings reveal a direct effect of rising atmospheric CO2, independent of temperature in delaying autumnal senescence for Populus, an important deciduous forest tree with implications for forest productivity and adaptation to a future high CO2 world.},

Here we focus on the newly emergent field of functional biogeography: the study of the geographic distribution of trait diversity across organizational levels. We show how functional biogeography bridges species-based biogeography and earth science to provide ideas and tools to help explain gradients in multifaceted diversity (including species, functional, and phylogenetic diversities), predict ecosystem functioning and services worldwide, and infuse regional and global conservation programs with a functional basis. Although much recent progress has been made possible because of the rising of multiple data streams, new developments in ecoinformatics, and new methodological advances, future directions should provide a theoretical and comprehensive framework for the scaling of biotic interactions across trophic levels and its ecological implications.},

	Abstract = {Interactions between insect herbivores and plants grown under conditions of ambient and elevated CO2 were investigated by analysing data on 43 herbivores, representing 61 plant-herbivore interactions. Changes in herbivore performance in enhanced CO2 environments were correlated with changes in the quality of the host plants, measured as nitrogen content, water content, carbohydrate content and secondary plant compounds. The data were analysed to determine whether CO2 mediated effects on insect performance differed between feeding guilds (leaf-chewers, leaf miners, phloem-feeders (root and shoot), xylem-feeders, whole-cell-feeders and seed-eaters) or instar stage. Host-plant quality changed in elevated CO2; leaf nitrogen content decreased, on average, by 15\% while carbohydrates increased by 47\% and secondary plant compounds (phenolics) by 31\%. Water content did not change. Of the variables measured, changes in nitrogen and carbohydrate levels only were found to be correlated with changes in food consumption. No differences were found in CO2-mediated herbivore responses on woody plant compared with non-woody plants. Insects from different feeding guilds respond to CO2 mediated changes in host-plant quality in various ways. Leaf-chewers generally seem able to compensate for the decreased nitrogen levels in the plant tissues by increasing their food consumption (by 30\%) and with no adverse effects on pupal weights. Leaf-miners only slightly increase their food consumption. The negative effect on pupal weight suggests that their population dynamics may change over several generations. Limited data on seed-eaters suggest that enhanced CO2 conditions have no effect on these insects. Phloem-feeders and whole-cell-feeders are the only insects to show a positive CO2 response. Population sizes generally increased in elevated CO2 and development lime of phloem-feeders was reduced by 17\%. Early instar larvae are restricted more by CO2 enhancement than late instars. Although changes in food consumption are similar, changes in development times are much more pronounced in young instars (18\% vs 6\%).},

The main purpose of our study was to determine if SLA and/or LDMC could be used as indicators of plant resource-use strategy in sand dune environments. The selected species were mainly distributed in three types of sand dunes: mobile sand dune, semi-fixed sand dune, and fixed sand dune. The three differed in their soil nutrient content and vegetation productivity. Both SLA and LDMC varied substantially among species in the different dunes. Maximum SLA (28.2 m(2) kg(-1)) was observed in the annual grass Setaria viridis in a fixed sand dune, and the lowest SLA (8.6 m(2) kg(-1)) was found in the perennial grass Pennisetum centrasiatum in a semi-fixed sand dune. LDMC varied from 0.10 g g(-1) for the annual forb Chenopodium glaucum in a fixed sand dune to 0.41 g g(-1) for the perennial grass Phragmitis australis in a fixed sand dune. For species common to two or three sites, their SLA and LDMC were significantly different between sites (P\&LT; 0.05), except for two species for SLA and six species for LDMC. SLA and LDMC were negatively correlated both in the three types of sand dunes and for each functional type (annual versus perennial species). However, SLA and LDMC were significantly correlated only for the species in fixed sand dune, perennial species as well as all specie. The results of our study showed that the SLA of annual plant species was generally higher than that of perennial species and that LDMC was significantly different between annual compared to perennial plants (P\&LT; 0.05).},

	Abstract = {Analysing the persistence and viability of small populations is a key issue in extinction theory and population viability analysis. However, there is still no consensus on how to quantify persistence and viability. We present an approach to evaluate any simulation model concerned with extinction. The approach is devised from general Markov models of stochastic population dynamics. From these models, we distil insights into the general mathematical structure of the risk of extinction by time t, P-0(t). From this mathematical structure, we devise a simple but effective protocolthe ln(1-P-0)-plotwhich is applicable for situations including environmental noise or catastrophes. This plot delivers two quantities which are fundamental to the assessment of persistence and viability: the intrinsic mean time to extinction, T-m, and the probability c(1) of the population reaching the established phase. The established phase is characterized by typical fluctuations of the population's state variable which can be described by quasi-stationary probability distributions. The risk of extinction in the established phase is constant and given by 1/T-m. We show that T-m is the basic currency for the assessment of persistence and viability because T-m is independent of initial conditions and allows the risk of extinction to be calculated for any time horizon. For situations where initial conditions are important, additionally c(1) has to be considered.},

Results of observational studies suggest that in many areas That have been analyzed, changes in total precipitation are amplified at the tails, and changes in some temperature extremes have been observed. Model output has been analyzed that shows changes in extreme events for future climates, such as increases in extreme high temperatures. decreases in extreme Low temperatures, and increases in intense precipitation events. In addition, the societal infrastructure is becoming more sensitive to weather and climate extremes, which would be exacerbated by climate change. In wild plants and animals, climate-induced extinctions, distributional and phenological changes, and species' range shifts are being documented at an increasing rate. Several apparently gradual biological changes are Linked to responses to extreme weather and climate events.},

	Abstract = {The stable carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of soil carbonate were measured on an eolian loess and red clay sequence at Lingtai, the Chinese Loess Plateau. This sequence is composed of 130 m of Tertiary red clay deposits with a basal age of 7.05 Ma overlain by 175 m of Pleistocene loess. In the field we identified ca. 110 carbonate nodule horizons in the red clay and 27 nodule horizons in the loess. These carbonate nodule horizons are formed by leaching and re-precipitation of carbonate from the eolian material. The delta(13)C record of soil carbonate indicates a major expansion of C-4 plants at ca. 4.0 Myr in the Loess Plateau. This event is comparable in timing with the expansion of C-4 plants in northern North America (Cerling et al., 1997. Nature 389, 153-158) but is ca. 3 million years later than the C-4 biomass expansion in Pakistan (Quade et al., 1989. Nature 342, 163-166). The pedogenic characteristics of the soils and the delta(18)O record in the red clay suggest that the C-4 plant expansion in the Loess Plateau was not driven by local climatic changes, which may support Cerling et al.'s (1997) assertion that the decline of atmospheric CO2 levels in the Neogene is responsible for this global vegetation change. Our record also implies that the Tibetan Plateau could have been uplifted to a critical height in the late Miocene, thus resulting in the formation of the atmospheric Great East-Asia Trough.

	Abstract = {* The dominant vegetation over much of the global land surface is not predetermined by contemporary climate, but also influenced by past environmental conditions. This confounds attempts to predict current and future biome distributions, because even a perfect model would project multiple possible biomes without knowledge of the historical vegetation state.


* Here we compare the distribution of tree- and grass-dominated biomes across Africa simulated using a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM). We explicitly evaluate where and under what conditions multiple stable biome states are possible for current and projected future climates.


* Our simulation results show that multiple stable biomes states are possible for vast areas of tropical and subtropical Africa under current conditions. Widespread loss of the potential for multiple stable biomes states is projected in the 21st Century, driven by increasing atmospheric CO2. Many sites where currently both tree-dominated and grass-dominated biomes are possible become deterministically tree-dominated.


* Regions with multiple stable biome states are widespread and require consideration when attempting to predict future vegetation changes. Testing for behaviour characteristic of systems with multiple stable equilibria, such as hysteresis and dependence on historical conditions, and the resulting uncertainty in simulated vegetation, will lead to improved projections of global change impacts.},

	Abstract = {In arid and semiarid environments surface-water strongly constrains the distribution and abundance of large herbivores during the dry season. Surprisingly, we know very little about its variability in natural ecosystems. Here we used long-term data on the dry-season occurrence of water at individual waterholes to model the surface-water availability across Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, under contrasted climatic and management scenarios. Without artificial pumping only 19.6\% of the park occurred within 5 km of water under average climatic conditions. However surface-water availability was strongly influenced by annual rainfall, and over 20 years the variability of the surface area of the park occurring within 5 km of water was slightly larger than the variability of rainfall. This contrasts with the usual buffered response of vegetation production to rainfall fluctuations, and suggests that the variability in dry-season foraging range determined by surface-water availability could be the main mechanism regulating the population dynamics of large herbivores in this environment. Artificial pumping increased surface-water availability and reduced its variability over time. Because changes in surface-water availability could cause the greatest changes in forage availability for large herbivores, we urge ecologists to investigate and report on the variability of surface-water in natural ecosystems, particularly where rapid climate changes are expected.},

	Abstract = {1. Callitris intratropica is a long-lived, obligate-seeding, fire-sensitive overstorey conifer that typically occurs in small groves ({\textless}0.1 ha) of much higher tree densities than the surrounding, eucalypt-dominated tropical savanna in northern Australia. We used C. intratropica groves of varying canopy cover to examine the role of feedbacks between fire and tree cover in the persistence of a fire-sensitive tree species and the maintenance of habitat heterogeneity in a highly flammable savanna. 2. We examined the population structure and floristic composition of C. intratropica groves and conducted controlled burns with Aboriginal landowners to test the prediction that groves of C. intratropica with closed canopies inhibit savanna fires by physically altering the fuel arrays below trees. We measured pre- and post-burn fuel availability, the probability of burning and fire intensity along transects (5575 m) spanning entire C. intratropica groves and extending into the surrounding savanna matrix. 3. We found that closed-canopy groves of C. intratropica had higher densities of seedlings and saplings than open-canopy groves and supported a distinct plant community. Closed-canopy groves also had a lower probability of burning and less severe fires due to a lower availability of fine fuels than the surrounding savanna. 4. Synthesis. Our results suggest that the observed regeneration within closed-canopy C. intratropica groves within frequently burnt savanna reflects a vegetationfire feedback. A significant, negative relationship between canopy cover and the probability of burning provides strong evidence that closed-canopy C. intratropica groves are capable of excluding low-intensity savanna fires, thereby enabling the persistence of patches of fire-sensitive forest or woodland amid open, highly flammable savanna vegetation. We present our findings as evidence that alternative stable state dynamics may play a role in determining savanna diversity and structure.},

@article{higgins_atmospheric_2012,
	Abstract = {It is possible that anthropogenic climate change will drive the Earth system into a qualitatively different state. Although different types of uncertainty limit our capacity to assess this risk, Earth system scientists are particularly concerned about tipping elements, large-scale components of the Earth system that can be switched into qualitatively different states by small perturbations. Despite growing evidence that tipping elements exist in the climate system, whether large-scale vegetation systems can tip into alternative states is poorly understood. Here we show that tropical grassland, savanna and forest ecosystems, areas large enough to have powerful impacts on the Earth system, are likely to shift to alternative states. Specifically, we show that increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration will force transitions to vegetation states characterized by higher biomass and/or woody-plant dominance. The timing of these critical transitions varies as a result of between-site variance in the rate of temperature increase, as well as a dependence on stochastic variation in fire severity and rainfall. We further show that the locations of bistable vegetation zones (zones where alternative vegetation states can exist) will shift as climate changes. We conclude that even though large-scale directional regime shifts in terrestrial ecosystems are likely, asynchrony in the timing of these shifts may serve to dampen, but not nullify, the shock that these changes may represent to the Earth system.},

In order to achieve reasonable results, temporal a priori information will be considered. Here, 'temporal smoothness' is used as a quite general, but for many applications sufficient, a priori information. This is justified in the case of slight movements during an x-ray scan in computerized tomography, or in the field of current density reconstruction, where one wants to conclude from electrical measurements on the surface of the head, the locations of brain activity. First, the notion of a dynamic inverse problem is introduced, then we describe how temporal smoothness can be incorporated in the regularization of the problem, and finally an efficient solver and some regularization properties of this solver are presented. This theory will be exploited in three practically relevant applications in a following paper.},

@article{medlyn_linking_2007,
	Abstract = {We tested the ability of a model to scale gas exchange from leaf level to whole-tree level by: (1) measuring leaf gas exchange in the canopy of 10 trees in a tal I Eucalyptus delegatensis RT Baker forest in NSW, Australia; (2) monitoring sap flow of the same 10 trees during the measurement week; and (3) using an individual-tree-based model (MAESTRA) to link the two sets of measurements. Photosynthesis and stomatal conductance components of the model were parameterized with the leaf gas exchange data, and canopy structure was parameterized with crown heights, dimensions and leaf areas of each of the measurement trees and up to 45 neighboring trees. Transpiration of the measurement trees was predicted by the model and compared with sap flow data. Leaf gas exchange parameters were similar for all 10 trees, with the exception of two smaller trees that had relatively low stomatal conductances. We hypothesize that these trees may have experienced water stress as a result of competition from large neighboring trees. The model performed well, and in most cases, was able to replicate the time course of tree transpiration. Maximum rates of transpiration were higher than measured rates for some trees and lower than measured rates for others, which may have been a result of inaccuracy in estimating tree leaf area. There was a small lag (about 15-30 minutes) between sap flow and modeled transpiration for some trees in the morning, likely associated with use of water stored in stems. The model also captured patterns of variation in sap flow among trees. Overall, the study confirms the ability of models to estimate forest canopy transpiration from leaf-level measurements.},

	Abstract = {Most field soils exhibit soil spatial variability as well as soil structure, The challenge is to account adequately for both types of spatial heterogeneity in simulation models. A numerical finite element code was used to compare single- and dual-permeability approaches for modeling variably saturated flow and transport in two-dimensional heterogeneous soil systems. The code was based on the Richards' equation for water how and the advection-dispersion equation for solute transport. Spatial variability in the soil hydraulic properties was accounted for by randomly generating a hydraulic conductivity field using a one-dimensional first-order Markov process, Soil structural effects were modeled with a two-domain concept in which a first-order kinetic expression is used to describe the transfer of water and solute between the two domains. Numerical experiments were carried out for the case of furrow irrigation, including the breakthrough of a conservative solute to the groundwater table. We compared five different scenarios: a single domain having uniform hydraulic properties (SU), a single domain with a randomly distributed hydraulic conductivity (SR), a dual-permeability system with uniform hydraulic properties (DU), a dual-permeability system with a randomly distributed fracture hydraulic conductivity (DRF), and a dual-permeability system having a randomly distributed matrix hydraulic conductivity (DRM). All scenarios started with pressure heads in equilibrium with a constant groundwater table 150 cm below the soil surface and zero initial solute concentrations. The simulated two-dimensional (2D) vertical concentration profiles showed preferential pathways resulting from both the spatial variability (SR) and soil structure (DRF) scenarios. As expected, drainage of water from the bottom of the profile occurred significantly earlier for dual-than for single-permeability scenarios. The combination of having spatial variability in the hydraulic properties and invoking the dual-permeability approach yielded the quickest and largest leaching of solute. The 2D dual-permeability approach should considerably improve the simulation of water and solute movement in naturally heterogeneous field soils. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V, All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Photosynthetic leaf traits were determined for savanna and forest ecosystems in West Africa, spanning a large range in precipitation. Standardized major axis fits revealed important differences between our data and reported global relationships. Especially for sites in the drier areas, plants showed higher photosynthetic rates for a given N or P when compared with relationships from the global data set. The best multiple regression for the pooled data set estimated Vcmax and Jmax from NDW and S. However, the best regression for different vegetation types varied, suggesting that the scaling of photosynthesis with leaf traits changed with vegetation types. A new model is presented representing independent constraints by N and P on photosynthesis, which can be evaluated with or without interactions with S. It assumes that limitation of photosynthesis will result from the least abundant nutrient, thereby being less sensitive to the allocation of the non-limiting nutrient to non-photosynthetic pools. The model predicts an optimum proportionality for N and P, which is distinct for Vcmax and Jmax and inversely proportional to S. Initial tests showed the model to predict Vcmax and Jmax successfully for other tropical forests characterized by a range of different foliar N and P concentrations.},

	Abstract = {I propose a methodology of sensitivity analysis applicable to complex process-based models. In application and discussion of this methodology, a model is conceived as a mechanism that is composed by multiple interacting processes. In this approach, model structure is explicitly investigated by analyzing the relationship that exists between process interactions and the emergent properties of the model. The methodology focuses on sensitivity analysis at the process level; and studies how process level uncertainty propagates through the network of modeled processes, affecting the dynamics generated through the interacting processes as well as the final model outcome. The information provided by this analysis can be used to ensure that the way in which the model operates resembles the phenomena being modeled, when uncertainties in processes are considered. It allows evaluation of the quality of a model and increases the confidence in model results. Some of the advantages of this approach are that it allows handling high levels of complexity by abstracting information at the process level, it facilitates the interpretation of model behavior and it provides information that allows exploration of how uncertainty in processes might affect model output.

	Abstract = {A model to predict global patterns in vegetation physiognomy was developed from physiological considerations influencing the distributions of different functional types of plant. Primary driving variables are mean coldest-month temperature, annual accumulated temperature over 5-degrees-C, and a drought index incorporating the seasonality of precipitation and the available water capacity of the soil. The model predicts which plant types can occur in a given environment, and selects the potentially dominant types from among them. Biomes arise as combinations of dominant types. Global environmental data were supplied as monthly means of temperature, precipitation and sunshine (interpolated to a global 0.5-degrees grid, with a lapse-rate correction) and soil texture class. The resulting predictions of global vegetation patterns were in good agreement with the mapped distribution of actual ecosystem complexes (Olson, J.S., Watts, J.A. \& Allison, L.J.

The model will help in assessing impacts of future climate changes on potential natural vegetation patterns, land-surface characteristics and terrestrial carbon storage, and in analysis of the effects of past climate change on these variables.},

	Abstract = {Urban bird communities exhibit high population densities and low species diversity, yet mechanisms behind these patterns remain largely untested. We present results from experimental studies of behavioral mechanisms underlying these patterns and provide a test of foraging theory applied to urban bird communities. We measured foraging decisions at artificial food patches to assess how urban habitats differ from wildlands in predation risk, missed-opportunity cost, competition, and metabolic cost. By manipulating seed trays, we compared leftover seed (giving-up density) in urban and desert habitats in Arizona. Deserts exhibited higher predation risk than urban habitats. Only desert birds quit patches earlier when increasing the missed-opportunity cost. House finches and house sparrows coexist by trading off travel cost against foraging efficiency. In exclusion experiments, urban doves were more efficient foragers than passerines. Providing water decreased digestive costs only in the desert. At the population level, reduced predation and higher resource abundance drive the increased densities in cities. At the community level, the decline in diversity may involve exclusion of native species by highly efficient urban specialists. Competitive interactions play significant roles in structuring urban bird communities. Our results indicate the importance and potential of mechanistic approaches for future urban bird community studies.},

	Abstract = {Process-based terrestrial ecosystem models have been widely used to simulate carbon cycle, climate and ecosystem interactions. Some parameters used in biological functions often change seasonally and inter-annually in this study, sequential data assimilation with an ensemble Kalman filter is designed to optimize the key parameters of the Boreal Ecosystem Producitivity Simulator (BEPS) model, taking into account the errors in the input, parameters and observation. The parameters adjusted through data assimilation include foliage clumping index (C-f), slope of stomatal conductance to the net photosynthetic rate (m), maximum photosynthetic carboxylation rate (V-c (max)) and electron transport rate (J(max)) at reference temperature of 25 degrees C, multiplier to the soil organic matter decomposition rates (K,). The fluxes of CO2 (separated into gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (RE)) and water vapor measured using the eddy covariance technique at the BOREAS/BERMS Old Aspen site, Canada during 1997-2004 are used for the optimization. Parameters are optimized at a daily time step and presented as 10-day averages. The results show that the parameters varied significantly at seasonal and inter-annual scales. Photosynthetic capacity V-c (max), J(max)) usually increased rapidly at the leaf expansion stage and reached a plateau in the early summer, then followed an abrupt decrease when foliage senescence occurred. The multiplier K, to soil respiration coefficients were reduced to 0.5 in wintertime; however it increased rapidly in the spring and reached about 1.0 in summertime. The intensity of soil respiration may be related to the metabolic responses of the microbial communities and the availability of labile substances in summer and winter. From leaf expanding in the spring to senescing in the autumn, Cf presented declining trend from 0.88 to 0.78 with slight variation; m increased from 5 and approached to an approximately stable value of 8 since early summer. With optimized parameters, the estimates of GPP, RE, net ecosystem production and water vapor fluxes were significantly improved compared with the measurements at daily and annual time steps. With eddy covariance fluxes, data assimilation with an ensemble Kalman filter can successfully retrieve the seasonal and inter-annual variations of parameters related to photosynthesis and respiration of this boreal ecosystem site.

There has been a decline in precipitation of 8 mm yr(-1) along the whole of the transect since about 1970. Simulations of vegetation dynamics and structure indicate that this decline has exerted a notable effect on the vegetation, with reductions in woody plant cover at the dry end of the transect and reductions in tree density at the wetter end. These changes were driven primarily by reductions in the net primary production and increased rates of mortality, with rather small impacts of fire.},

	Abstract = {We examine the influence of climate, soil properties and vegetation characteristics on soil organic carbon (SOC) along a transect of West African ecosystems sampled across a precipitation gradient on contrasting soil types stretching from Ghana (15 degrees N) to Mali (7 degrees N). Our findings derive from a total of 1108 soil cores sampled over 14 permanent plots. The observed pattern in SOC stocks reflects the very different climatic conditions and contrasting soil properties existing along the latitudinal transect. The combined effects of these factors strongly influence vegetation structure. SOC stocks in the first 2 m of soil ranged from 20 Mg C ha-1 for a Sahelian savanna in Mali to over 120 Mg C ha-1 for a transitional forest in Ghana. The degree of interdependence between soil bulk density (SBD) and soil properties is highlighted by the strong negative relationships observed between SBD and SOC (r2 {\textgreater} 0.84). A simple predictive function capable of encompassing the effect of climate, soil properties and vegetation type on SOC stocks showed that available water and sand content taken together could explain 0.84 and 0.86 of the total variability in SOC stocks observed to 0.3 and 1.0 m depth respectively. Used in combination with a suitable climatic parameter, sand content is a good predictor of SOC stored in highly weathered dry tropical ecosystems with arguably less confounding effects than provided by clay content. There was an increased contribution of resistant SOC to the total SOC pool for lower rainfall soils, this likely being the result of more frequent fire events in the grassier savannas of the more arid regions. This work provides new insights into the mechanisms determining the distribution of carbon storage in tropical soils and should contribute significantly to the development of robust predictive models of biogeochemical cycling and vegetation dynamics in tropical regions.},

	Abstract = {1. We employed standardized measurement techniques and protocols to describe the size dependence of whole-tree water use and cross-sectional area of conducting xylem (sapwood) among several species of angiosperms and conifers. 2. The results were not inconsistent with previously proposed 3/4-power scaling of water transport with estimated above-ground biomass. However, for a given size, angiosperms transported considerably greater quantities of water than conifers. 3. In the angiosperms studied, the scaling of water transport with sapwood area, stem diameter and above-ground biomass was best described by sigmoid functions rather than a power function, consistent with the previously reported size dependence of other processes such as growth. 4. At least three distinct species groupings for relationships between sapwood area and stem basal area were observed. Scaling of sapwood area with stem radius was well described by a power function of the form Y = Y0Xb. However, exponents obtained for two of the three species groups differed significantly from a recently proposed theoretical value of 2.33.},

As an example we consider a control system with pulse-width modulation described by a three-dimensional set of piecewise-linear nonautonomous equations. It is shown that the domains of synchronization of quasiperiodic oscillations for piecewise-smooth dynamical systems differ in an essential way from the classical Arnol'd tongues. The difference lies in the inner structure and bifurcational transitions. There are two different kinds of synchronization domains, one of which contains regions of bistability. The structure of border-collision bifurcation boundaries of synchronization tongues and transitions to chaos via border-collision bifurcations of cycles on a two-dimensional torus are described in detail.

@article{beringer_savanna_2007,
	Abstract = {Savannas comprise a large area of the global land surface and are subject to frequent disturbance through fire. The role of fire as one of the primary natural carbon cycling mechanisms is a key issue in considering global change feedbacks. The savannas of Northern Australia burn regularly and we aimed to determine their annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and the impact of fire on productivity. We established a long-term eddy covariance flux tower at Howard Springs, Australia and present here 5 years of data from 2001 to 2005. Fire has direct impacts through emissions but also has indirect effects through the loss of productivity due to reduced functional leaf area index and the carbon costs of rebuilding the canopy. The impact of fire on the canopy latent energy exchange was evident for 40 days while the canopy was rebuilt; however, the carbon balance took approximately 70 days to recover. The annual fire free NEP at Howard Springs was estimated at -4.3 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) with a range of -3.5 to -5.1 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) across years. We calculated the average annual indirect fire effect as +0.7 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) using a neural network model approach and estimated average emissions of fine and coarse fuels as +1.6 t C ha(-1) yr(-1). This allowed us to calculate a net biome production of -2.0 t C ha(-1) yr(-1). We then partitioned this remaining sink and suggest that most of this can be accounted for by woody increment (1.2 t C ha(-1) yr(-1)) and shrub encroachment (0.5 t C ha(-1) yr(-1)). Given the consistent sink at this site, even under an almost annual fire regime, there may be management options to increase carbon sequestration by reducing fire frequency.},

	Abstract = {Using a two-locus diallelic population genetic model, we studied the evolution and impact of flammable traits in resprouting plants. A flammability locus' determines the flammable character of a plant and the frequency of alleles at this locus affects the probability that any plant in the population will burn. A linked 'disturbance locus' determines how a plant fares in the presence or absence of fire. Thus, the frequencies of alleles at the flammability locus influence evolution at the disturbance locus. The evolution of flammability-enhancing alleles is influenced by asymmetries in the genotypic fitnesses as well as by the base flammability of the population and the genetic structure of the system (with tighter linkage increasing the possibility that the population becomes more flammable). We demonstrate that stable polymorphisms of plants differing in flammability alleles are possible. The magnitude of the organism's impact on the flammable character of the environment influences where such polymorphisms are expected. Furthermore, predictions concerning the evolution of alleles at the disturbance locus based solely on fitness asymmetries may fail due to the influence of plants on their environment. Unusual population dynamics, including stable and unstable cycles of genotypes, are also presented. The relation of this model to the Mutch hypothesis and the recently developed theories of 'niche construction' and 'ecosystem engineering' is discussed.},

	Abstract = {How great an effect does self-generated spatial structure have on logistic population growth? Results are described from an individual-based model (IBM) with spatially localized dispersal and competition, and from a deterministic approximation to the IBM describing the dynamics of the first and second spatial moments. The dynamical system incorporates a novel closure that gives a close approximation to the IBM in the presence of strong spatial structure. Population growth given by the spatial logistic model can differ greatly from that of the nonspatial logistic equation. Numerical simulations show that populations may grow more slowly or more rapidly than would be expected from the nonspatial model, and may reach their maximum rate of increase at densities other than half of the carrying capacity. Populations can achieve asymptotic densities substantially greater than or less than the carrying capacity of the nonspatial logistic model. and can even tend towards extinction. These properties of the spatial logistic model are caused by local dispersal and competition that affect spatial structure, which in turn affect, Population growth. Accounting for these local spatial processes brings the theory of single-species population growth a step closer to the growth of real spatially structured populations.},

These changes in composition are accompanied by an increase in above-ground biomass. Our results indicate that by altering composition in favour of drought-tolerant species, the biomass stocks of these forests may be more resilient to longer term drought than short-term studies of severe individual droughts suggest.},

	Abstract = {Robustness of coexistence against changes of parameters is investigated in a model-independent manner by analyzing the feedback loop of population regulation. We define coexistence as a fixed point of the community dynamics with no population having zero size. It is demonstrated that the parameter range allowing coexistence shrinks and disappears when the Jacobian of the dynamics decreases to zero. A general notion of regulating factors/variables is introduced. For each population, its impact and sensitivity niches are defined as the differential impact on, and the differential sensitivity towards, the regulating variables, respectively. Either the similarity of the impact niches or the similarity of the sensitivity niches results in a small Jacobian and in a reduced likelihood of coexistence. For the case of a resource continuum, this result reduces to the usual '' limited niche overlap '' picture for both kinds of niche. As an extension of these ideas to the coexistence of infinitely many species, we demonstrate that Roughgarden's example for coexistence of a continuum of populations is structurally unstable.

	Abstract = {The response of soil organic carbon to climate change might lead to significant feedbacks affecting global warming. This response can be studied by coupled climate-carbon cycle models but so far the description of soil organic carbon cycle in these models has been quite simple. In this work we used the coupled climate-carbon cycle model ECHAM5/JSBACH (European Center/Hamburg Model 5/Jena Scheme for Biosphere-Atmosphere Coupling in Hamburg) with two different soil carbon modules, namely (1) the original soil carbon model of JSBACH called CBALANCE and (2) a new soil carbon model Yasso07, to study the interaction between climate variability and soil organic carbon. Equivalent ECHAM5/JSBACH simulations were conducted using both soil carbon models, with freely varying atmospheric CO(2) for the last 30 years (1977-2006). In this study, anthropogenic CO(2) emissions and ocean carbon cycle were excluded. The new model formulation produced soil carbon stock estimates that were much closer to measured values. It also captured better the seasonal cycle of the direct CO(2) exchange measurements at the three grassland sites considered (RMS error reduced by 12\%), while for the five forest sites also analyzed, the results were ambiguous and the RMS error was 12\% larger for Yasso07 than for CBALANCE. As a response to climatic changes, Yasso07 showed greater release of soil carbon to the atmosphere than the original model formulation during the years 1977-2006. This emphasizes the need for better understanding the processes affecting soil carbon stocks and their turnover rates to predict the climatic feedbacks.},

	Abstract = {The global distribution of vegetation is broadly determined by and where bioclimatic parameters are favorable for several plant functional types (PFTs), by the competition between them. Most current dynamic vegetation models (DGVMs) do not, however, explicitly simulate intercompetition and instead determine the existence and fractional coverage of based on quasi- equilibrium climatevegetation relationships. When competition is explicitly simulated, versions of LotkaVolterra ( LV) equations in the context of interaction between animal species are almost used. These equations may, however, exhibit unrealistic behavior in cases and do not, for example, allow the coexistence of different PFTs in situations. Coexistence may, however, be obtained by introducing and mechanisms such as temporal environmental variation and disturbance, among others. A generalized version of the competition equations is proposed that includes the LV equations as a special case, which successfully models competition for a range of climate and vegetation regimes and for which coexistence is a permissible equilibrium solution in the absence of additional mechanisms. The approach is tested for boreal forest, tropical forest, savanna, and temperate forest locations within the framework of the Canadian Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (CTEM) and successfully simulates the observed successional behavior and the observed near-equilibrium distribution of coexisting PFTs.},

The IDH states that diversity of competing species is, or should be expected to be, maximized at intermediate frequencies and/or intensities of disturbance or environmental change. I argue that the IDH has been refuted on both empirical and theoretical grounds, and so should be abandoned. Empirical studies only rarely find the predicted humped diversity--disturbance relationship. Theoretically, the three major mechanisms thought to produce humped diversity--disturbance relationships are logically invalid and do not actually predict what they are thought to predict.

@article{king_potential_1997,
	Abstract = {We use a georeferenced model of ecosystem carbon dynamics to explore the sensitivity of global terrestrial carbon storage to changes in atmospheric CO2 and climate. We model changes in ecosystem carbon density, but we do not model shifts in vegetation type. A model of annual NPP is coupled with a model of carbon allocation in vegetation and a model of decomposition and soil carbon dynamics. NPP is a function of climate and atmospheric CO2 concentration. The CO2 response is derived from a biochemical model of photosynthesis. With no change in climate, a doubling of atmospheric CO2 from 280 ppm to 560 ppm enhances equilibrium global NPP by 16.9\%; equilibrium global terrestrial ecosystem carbon (TEC) increases by 14.9\%. Simulations with no change in atmospheric CO2 concentration but changes in climate from five atmospheric general circulation models yield increases in global NPP of 10.0-14.8\%. The changes in NPP are very nearly balanced by changes in decomposition, and the resulting changes in TEC range from an increase of 1.1\% to a decrease of 1.1\%. These results are similar to those from analyses using bioclimatic biome models that simulate shifts in ecosystem distribution but do not model changes in carbon density within vegetation types. With changes in both climate and a doubling of atmospheric CO2, our model generates increases in NPP of 30.2-36.5\%. The increases in NPP and litter inputs to the soil more than compensate for any climate stimulation of decomposition and lead to increases in global TEC of 15.4-18.2\%.},

Particular attention is given to the impact of timing and amount of rainfall, plant physiology, and soil properties. From the statistical characterization of the crossing properties of arbitrary levels of soil moisture, Part III develops an expression for vegetation water stress [A. Porporato, F. Laio, L. Ridolfi, I. Rodriguez-Iturbe, Adv. Water Res. 24 (7) (2001) 725--744]. This measure of stress is then employed to quantify the response of plants to soil moisture deficit as well as to infer plant suitability to given environmental conditions and understand some of the reasons for possible coexistence of different species. Detailed applications of these concepts are developed in Part IV [F. Laio, A. Porporato, C.P. Fernandez-Illescas, I. Rodriguez-Iturbe, Adv.

@article{archibald_growing_2003,
	Abstract = {In order to investigate how environmental factors other than light availability affect tree architecture, differences in branching architecture and allometry were analysed in populations of Acacia karroo Hein. from three different environments in South Africa: forests, savannas and arid-shrublands. Factors such as fire and herbivory have a large effect on tree life history in certain environments and are likely to have selected for trees that have different architectures from those of forest trees, whose major limitation is light assimilation.
Significant differences were found in stem architecture and branching architecture between trees in each environment. Compared with forest trees, trees in savannas had an elongated growth form with small canopy and leaf areas, and tall, thin, unbranched trunks. Trees in arid areas showed opposite trends with wider canopies, and increased lateral branching. Savanna trees had significantly smaller spines than trees in other environments, and both forest and savanna trees showed delayed reproduction.
These differences are probably related to a trade-off between an architecture geared towards rapid height-gain and one promoting lateral spread, and can be explained with reference to the different selective pressures in each environment. In forests, vertical and horizontal growth are both important. However, in savannas there is a great pressure for rapid vertical growth to escape fires, while in arid areas a defensive, lateral growth form is selected for.
Savanna trees and arid karoo trees have evolved architectures that are more extreme vertically and laterally than the range of architectures displayed in a forest community.},

	Abstract = {A meta-analysis was conducted on field-competition experiments published in six journals over a 10-yr period. We analyzed the effects of competition on the biomass of organisms belonging to 93 species in a wide variety of habitats. Competition had a large effect overall, with a great deal of heterogeneity in that effect among organisms. There were large differences among trophic levels in competitive effects, but the relative magnitude of competition at different trophic levels was contrary to the predictions of ecological theory. Primary producers and carnivores displayed small to medium effects. In these two groups, interspecific effects did not differ from intraspecific effects, nor did effects differ in terrestrial versus aquatic habitats. The effects of competition on herbivores ranged from large effects on anurans and lotic arthropods, to medium effects on marine mollusks and echinoderms, to effects that were not statistically distinguishable from zero for terrestrial arthropods. Interspecific competitive effects among these herbivore groups were generally less than intraspecific effects. Among primary producers, the effects of competition were not different in high- and low-productivity habitats. Across all taxa, large organisms did not experience greater competitive effects than small organisms, and competitive effects did not depend on the size attained in the absence of competitors. The effects of competition were weakly density-dependent in cases in which it was possible to examine the effects of the density of neighbors. Experiments conducted on caged organisms resulted in greater competitive effects than those with free-roaming and unenclosed organisms. Experiments with small sample sizes, short durations, and poor experimental design were more variable than experiments that were larger, longer, and better planned.},

@article{wullschleger_plant_2014,
	Abstract = {Background Earth system models describe the physical, chemical and biological processes that govern our global climate. While it is difficult to single out one component as being more important than another in these sophisticated models, terrestrial vegetation is a critical player in the biogeochemical and biophysical dynamics of the Earth system. There is much debate, however, as to how plant diversity and function should be represented in these models.
Scope Plant functional types (PFTs) have been adopted by modellers to represent broad groupings of plant species that share similar characteristics (e.g. growth form) and roles (e.g. photosynthetic pathway) in ecosystem function. In this review, the PFT concept is traced from its origin in the early 1800s to its current use in regional and global dynamic vegetation models (DVMs). Special attention is given to the representation and parameterization of PFTs and to validation and benchmarking of predicted patterns of vegetation distribution in high-latitude ecosystems. These ecosystems are sensitive to changing climate and thus provide a useful test case for model-based simulations of past, current and future distribution of vegetation.
Conclusions Models that incorporate the PFT concept predict many of the emerging patterns of vegetation change in tundra and boreal forests, given known processes of tree mortality, treeline migration and shrub expansion. However, representation of above- and especially below-ground traits for specific PFTs continues to be problematic. Potential solutions include developing trait databases and replacing fixed parameters for PFTs with formulations based on trait co-variance and empirical trait--environment relationships. Surprisingly, despite being important to land--atmosphere interactions of carbon, water and energy, PFTs such as moss and lichen are largely absent from DVMs. Close collaboration among those involved in modelling with the disciplines of taxonomy, biogeography, ecology and remote sensing will be required if we are to overcome these and other shortcomings.},

@article{foley_integrated_1996,
	Abstract = {Here we present a new terrestrial biosphere model (the Integrated Biosphere Simulator - IBIS) which demonstrates how land surface biophysics, terrestrial carbon fluxes, and global vegetation dynamics can be represented in a single, physically consistent modeling framework. In order to integrate a wide range of biophysical, physiological, and ecological processes, the model is designed around a hierarchical, modular structure and uses a common state description throughout. First, a coupled simulation of the surface water, energy, and carbon fluxes is performed on hourly timesteps and is integrated over the year to estimate the annual water and carbon balance. Next, the annual carbon balance is used to predict changes in the leaf area index and biomass for each of nine plant functional types, which compete for light and water using different ecological strategies. The resulting patterns of annual evapotranspiration, runoff, and net primary productivity are in good agreement with observations. In addition, the model simulates patterns of vegetation dynamics that qualitatively agree with features of the natural process of secondary succession. Comparison of the model's inferred near-equilibrium vegetation categories with a potential natural vegetation map shows a fair degree of agreement. This integrated modeling framework provides a means of simulating both rapid biophysical processes and long-term ecosystem dynamics that can be directly incorporated within atmospheric models.},

In this study changes of structure in two tropical savanna areas with contrasting history of fire protection in the central Brazilian Cerrado is documented. Location Vegetation was sampled with line intercept transects in two adjacent sites in Brasilia, Federal District. These transects were located within a nature reserve protected from fire since 1972 and within an adjacent reserve area that burns every 2 years. Methods Five savanna physiognomies, from a low forest ('cerradao') to an open savanna ('campo sujo'), were sampled in both sites. Results Fire protection increased the abundance of woody plants and favoured fire-sensitive species. With some exceptions, shrubs tended to be less affected by fire than trees. Species distribution was affected by a complex interaction of fire and physiognomy. Fire had the strongest effect on 'campo sujo' savanna, and a less significant effect on the intermediate physiognomies. Main conclusions Protection permits the establishment of fire sensitive species. A long enough protection against fire could lead to the appearance of more wooded physiognomies in the Cerrado.},

We describe the changes in the bifurcation diagram of the bistable system: we find that the region of bistability is reduced for small amounts of noise while for noise beyond a critical width bistability vanishes completely in the regime where bistability is eliminated by the noise, the time series of the solution shows that the system can undergo frequent catastrophic regime shifts. We also discuss how some of the results depend on model-specific details.

@article{popp_simulating_2007,
	Abstract = {In arid and semi-arid savannas, species diversity is strongly influenced by structural diversity, which in these systems is characteristically formed by woody vegetation. Shrub encroachment, associated with overgrazing by domestic livestock, changes the structural diversity and hence affects biodiversity. Many investigations have been carried out with focus on the structure building trees, but little is known about the importance of shrubs. Here, we present a spatially explicit and individual-based population model for analysing the influence of shrub encroachment on the occurrence of yellow mongooses (Cynictis penicillata) in the Southern Kalahari, South Africa. This analysis is based on field investigations in Southern Africa. The results of the modelling study are in line with the results of a field study, in which the same unimodal relationship between shrub cover and yellow mongoose abundance was found. The model could explain this relationship by the need of shrubs as protective structures on the one hand, and the need of foraging habitat in the grass matrix on the other hand. To evaluate the factors influencing the population dynamics at different levels of shrub encroachment we carried out an extensive sensitivity analysis. Finally, we determined a range of existence of the yellow mongoose for various shrub covers. Model results indicate a lower and an upper limit of critical shrub densities at 1\% and 38\%, respectively. These limits indicate the range in shrub cover allowing the persistence of the yellow mongoose in the Southern Kalahari. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{goheen_large_2010,
	Abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Savanna ecosystems are defined largely by tree-grass mixtures, and tree establishment is a key driver of community structure and ecosystem function in these systems. The factors controlling savanna tree establishment are understudied, but likely involve some combination of seed, microsite and predator/fire limitation. In African savannas, suppression and killing of adult trees by large mammals like elephants (Loxodonta africana Blumenbach, 1797) and giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis Linnaeus, 1758) can maintain tree-grass co-dominance, although the impacts of even these conspicuous herbivores on tree establishment also are poorly understood. 2. We combined seed addition and predator exclusion experiments with a large-scale, long-term field manipulation of large herbivores to investigate the relative importance of seeds, microsites and predators in limiting establishment of a monodominant tree (Acacia drepanolobium Sjostedt) in a Kenyan savanna. 3. Both wild and domestic (i.e. cattle; Bos taurus Linnaeus, 1758) large herbivores facilitated tree establishment by suppressing abundances of rodents, the most important seed and seedling predators. However, this indirect, positive effect of wild herbivores was negated by wild herbivores' suppression of seed production. Cattle did not have this direct, negative impact; rather, they further assisted tree establishment by reducing cover of understorey grasses. Thus, the impacts of both groups of large herbivores on tree establishment were largely routed through other taxa, with a negligible net effect of wild herbivores and a positive net effect of cattle on tree establishment. 4. The distinction between the (positive) net effect of cattle and (neutral) net effect of wild herbivores is due to the inclusion of browsers and mixed feeders within the assemblage of wild herbivores. Browsing by wild herbivores limited seed production, which reduced tree recruitment; grazing by cattle was more pronounced than that by wild herbivores, and thus promoted germination and subsequent establishment of small trees. 5. Our study is the first to link seed fates to tree establishment in savanna ecosystems in experimentally-manipulated herbivore communities. Further, our results highlight how large herbivores can modify a suite of independent factors - seed production, competition with understorey species, and seed and seedling predation - to collectively drive tree establishment.},

	Abstract = {The principle of competitive exclusion is a fundamental tenet of ecology. Commonly used competition models predict that at most only one species per limiting resource can coexist in the same environment at steady state; hence, the upper limit to species diversity depends only on the number of limiting resources and not on the rates of resource supply. We demonstrate that such model behavior is the result of both the growth and biomass turnover functions being proportional to the population biomass. We argue that at least the growth function should be a nonlinear, concave downward function of biomass. This form for the growth function should arise simply because of changes in the allometry of individuals in the population. With this change in model structure, we show that any number of species can coexist at an asymptotically stable steady state, even where there is only one limiting resource. Furthermore, if growth increases nonlinearly with biomass, the steady-state resource concentration and hence the potential for biodiversity increases as the resource supply rate increases.},

	Abstract = {The fine root systems of three tropical montane forests differing in age and history were investigated in the Cordillera Talamanca, Costa Rica. We analyzed abundance, vertical distribution, and morphology of fine roots in an early successional forest (10-15 years old, FSF), a mid-successional forest (40 years old, MSF), and a nearby undisturbed old-growth forest (OGF), and related the root data to soil morphological and chemical parameters. The OGF stand contained a 19 cm deep organic layer on the forest floor (i.e., 530 mol C/m(2)) which was two and five times thicker than that of the MSF (10 cm) and ESF stands (4 cm), respectively. There was a corresponding decrease in fine root biomass in this horizon from 1128 g dry matter/m(2) in the old-growth forest to 337 (MSF) and 31 g/m(2) (ESF) in the secondary forests, although the stands had similar leaf areas. The organic layer was a preferred substrate for fine root growth in the old-growth forest as indicated by more than four times higher fine root densities (root mass per soil volume) than in the mineral topsoil (0-10 cm); in the two secondary forests, root densities in the organic layer were equal to or lower than in the mineral soil. Specific fine root surface areas and specific root tip abundance (tips per unit root dry mass) were significantly greater in the roots of the ESF than the MSF and OGF stands. Most roots of the ESF trees (8 abundant species) were infected by VA mycorrhizal fungi; ectomycorrhizal species (Quercus copeyensis and Q. costaricensis) were dominant in the MSF and OGF stands. Replacement of tropical montane oak forest by secondary forest in Costa Rica has resulted in (1) a large reduction of tree fine root biomass; (2) a substantial decrease in depth of the organic layer (and thus in preferred rooting space); and (3) a great loss of soil carbon and nutrients. Whether old-growth Quercus forests maintain a very high fine root biomass because their ectomycorrhizal rootlets are less effective in nutrient absorption than those of VA mycorrhizal secondary forests, or if their nutrient demand is much higher than that of secondary forests (despite a similar leaf area and leaf mass production), remains unclear.},

Their dynamics often obscure how turgor drives wall extension for growth, and different flow paths for roots and shoots have different dynamics.

Invasive species were hypothesized to have highher seedling relative growth rates (RGRs) and specific leaf areas (SLAs) than did related less-invasive species. In phylogenetically independent contrasts conducted among taxa within families, high seedling RGRs and SLAs have significant positive associations with woody plant invasiveness.

	Abstract = {Most models of plant competition represent competition as taking place between species when realistically competition takes place between individuals. We model individual plants as optimally choosing biomass in order to maximize net energy that is directed into reproduction. Competition is for access to light and a plant that grows more biomass adds to the leaf are a index, creating negative feedback in the form of more self shading and shading of its neighbors. In each period and forgiven species densities, simultaneous maximization by all plants yields an equilibrium characterized by optimum biomasses. Between periods the net energies plants obtain are used to update the densities, and if densities change the equilibrium changes in the subsequent period. A steady state is attained when all plants have net energies that just allow for replacement. Four main predictions of the resource ratio theory of competition are obtained, providing behavioral underpinnings for species level models. However, if individual plant parameters are not identical across species, then the predictions do not follow. The optimization frame work yields many other predictions, including how specific leaf areas and resource stress impact biomass and leaf area indices. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{niet_patterns_2009,
	Abstract = {Plant species have accumulated in the Cape region of southern Africa to a much greater degree than in areas of equivalent size in the rest of the subcontinent. Although this could be a consequence simply of lower extinction rates in the Cape, most researchers have invoked high rates of ecological speciation, driven by unique aspects of the Cape environment, as the primary explanation for this richness. To assess these ideas, we analyzed the frequencies of ecological shifts among 188 sister species pairs obtained from molecular phylogenies of eight Cape clades. Ecological shifts were evident in 80\% of sister species pairs, with general habitat, pollinator, and fire-survival strategy shifts being especially frequent. Contrary to an established idea that shifts in soil type are frequently associated with speciation of Cape taxa, these shifts were relatively rare, occurring in just 17\% of species pairs. More cases of sister species divergence are accompanied solely by floral than by vegetative diversification, suggesting an important role for pollinator-driven speciation. In an analysis of two large orchid genera that have radiated in both the Cape and the rest of southern Africa, the frequency of ecological shifts (general habitat, soil type, altitude and flowering time), did not differ between sister species pairs in the Cape region and those outside it. Despite suggestions that Cape plants tend to have small range sizes and show fine-scale patterns of speciation, range size did not differ significantly between species in the Cape and those outside it. We conclude that ecological speciation is likely to have been important for radiation of the Cape flora, but there is no evidence as yet for special ``Cape'' patterns of ecological speciation.},

	Abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Plant-soil interactions play a central role in the biogeochemical carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and hydrological cycles. In the context of global environmental change, they are important both in modulating the impact of climate change and in regulating the feedback of greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, CH4 and N2O) to the climate system. 2. Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) represent the most advanced tools available to predict the impacts of global change on terrestrial ecosystem functions and to examine their feedbacks to climate change. The accurate representation of plant-soil interactions in these models is crucial to improving predictions of the effects of climate change on a global scale. 3. In this paper, we describe the general structure of DGVMs that use plant functional types (PFTs) classifications as a means to integrate plant-soil interactions and illustrate how models have been developed to improve the simulation of: (a) soil carbon dynamics, (b) nitrogen cycling, (c) drought impacts and (d) vegetation dynamics. For each of these, we discuss some recent advances and identify knowledge gaps. 4. We identify three ongoing challenges, requiring collaboration between the global modelling community and process ecologists. First, the need for a critical evaluation of the representation of plant-soil processes in global models; second, the need to supply and integrate knowledge into global models; third, the testing of global model simulations against large-scale multifactor experiments and data from observatory gradients. 5. Synthesis. This paper reviews how plant-soil interactions are represented in DGVMs that use PFTs and illustrates some model developments. We also identify areas of ecological understanding and experimentation needed to reduce uncertainty in future carbon coupled climate change predictions.},

	Abstract = {One of the greatest sources of uncertainty for future climate predictions is the response of the global carbon cycle to climate change(1). Although approximately one-half of total CO2 emissions is at present taken up by combined land and ocean carbon reservoirs(2), models predict a decline in future carbon uptake by these reservoirs, resulting in a positive carbon-climate feedback(3). Several recent studies suggest that rates of carbon uptake by the land(4-6) and ocean(7-10) have remained constant or declined in recent decades. Other work, however, has called into question the reported decline(11-13). Here we use global-scale atmospheric CO2 measurements, CO2 emission inventories and their full range of uncertainties to calculate changes in global CO2 sources and sinks during the past 50 years. Our mass balance analysis shows that net global carbon uptake has increased significantly by about 0.05 billion tonnes of carbon per year and that global carbon uptake doubled, from 2.4 +/- 0.8 to 5.0 +/- 0.9 billion tonnes per year, between 1960 and 2010. Therefore, it is very unlikely that both land and ocean carbon sinks have decreased on a global scale. Since 1959, approximately 350 billion tonnes of carbon have been emitted by humans to the atmosphere, of which about 55 per cent has moved into the land and oceans. Thus, identifying the mechanisms and locations responsible for increasing global carbon uptake remains a critical challenge in constraining the modern global carbon budget and predicting future carbon-climate interactions.},

@article{medvigy_mechanistic_2009,
	Abstract = {Insights into how terrestrial ecosystems affect the Earth's response to changes in climate and rising atmospheric CO2 levels rely heavily on the predictions of terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs). These models contain detailed mechanistic representations of biological processes affecting terrestrial ecosystems; however, their ability to simultaneously predict field-based measurements of terrestrial vegetation dynamics and carbon fluxes has remained largely untested. In this study, we address this issue by developing a constrained implementation of a new structured TBM, the Ecosystem Demography model version 2 (ED2), which explicitly tracks the dynamics of fine-scale ecosystem structure and function. Carbon and water flux measurements from an eddy-flux tower are used in conjunction with forest inventory measurements of tree growth and mortality at Harvard Forest (42.5$\,^{\circ}$N, 72.1$\,^{\circ}$W) to estimate a number of important but weakly constrained model parameters. Evaluation against a decade of tower flux and forest dynamics measurements shows that the constrained ED2 model yields greatly improved predictions of annual net ecosystem productivity, carbon partitioning, and growth and mortality dynamics of both hardwood and conifer trees. The generality of the model formulation is then evaluated by comparing the model's predictions against measurements from two other eddy-flux towers and forest inventories of the northeastern United States and Quebec. Despite the markedly different composition throughout this region, the optimized model realistically predicts observed patterns of carbon fluxes and tree growth. These results demonstrate how TBMs parameterized with field-based measurements can provide quantitative insight into the underlying biological processes governing ecosystem composition, structure, and function at larger scales.},

	Abstract = {Common reed (Phragmites australis) is a prominent species in the upstream part of the eutrophic Scheldt estuary (Belgium, The Netherlands). From 1996 till 1998, seasonal growth dynamics of the species were studied in two monospecific stands subjected to different salinity regimes (seasonal means 1.6 and 13.3 PSU, respectively). We addressed the following questions: how are these reed vegetations affected by meteorological conditions and by the growth site, what are the important growth processes and what is the fate of the annually fixed carbon. A mathematical model was developed and calibrated using the data from the oligohaline site. Subsequent application of the model to the mesohaline stand required adaptation of parameters relating to the partitioning of resources and timing of growth initiation only. At their peak, the aboveground biomass was 587-1678 g DW m(-2) at the 13.3 PSU site and 1116-2179 g DW m(-2) (1.6 PSU); more than 60\% of the biomass was located underground. In 1996, biomasses were 2-3 times lower than in the other 2 years, caused by a retarded growth initiation. Probably due to a lower temperature in early 1996, rhizome bud burst occurred more than 1 month later compared to the other years. In addition, growth initiation was several weeks later in the mesohaline site. This appeared mainly responsible for the large difference in maximal aboveground biomass between both stations. Architecture of the plants was also affected, with a higher shoot density (about 50\% more shoots), better-developed root system (15\% of total belowground biomass compared to 5\%) and more, but smaller leaves at the higher salinity site. Notwithstanding large differences in aboveground biomass, annual growth was similar at both stations (154 and 132 mol C m(-2) per year at the oligo- and mesohaline station, respectively). Primary production accounted for about 80\% of all growth processes, rhizome remobilization for almost 20\%, translocation of mass before sloughing of leaves accounting about 3\%. Within a year, some 44\% (oligohaline) and 36\% (mesohaline) of new assimilates produced by photosynthesis accumulated as dead litter. The other part was respired by the plant itself, either to provide the energy for growth (23\%) or maintenance costs (33-41\% at the oligo- and mesohaline station, respectively). Calculated annual turnover rates of aboveground biomass, rhizomes and roots were 100, 62 and 73\%, respectively. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The model reproduced the fire regime characteristics for a wide variety of regions of Mediterranean climate in California, France and Spain. The Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) methodology was used to assess the possibility of multiple model parameter sets being consistent with the available calibration data. The resulting set of behavioural models was used to assess uncertainty in the predictions. The results suggested that (1) for a given region, the total area burned is much the same whether suppression or prescribed fire policies are used or not; however fire suppression enhances fire intensity and prescribed burning reduces it; (2) the proportion of large fires can be reduced, but not eliminated, using prescribed fires, especially in areas which have the highest proportion of large fires.},

	Abstract = {Through estimations of above- and below-ground standing biomass, annual biomass increment, fine root production and turnover, litterfall, canopy respiration and total soil CO2 efflux, a carbon balance on seasonal and yearly time-scales is developed for a Eucalypt open-forest savanna in northern Australia. This carbon balance is compared to estimates of carbon fluxes derived from eddy covariance measurements conducted at the same site. The total carbon (C) stock of the savanna was 204+/-53 ton C ha(-1), with approximately 84\% below-ground and 16\% above-ground. Soil organic carbon content (0-1 m) was 151+/-33 ton C ha(-1), accounting for about 74\% of the total carbon content in the ecosystem. Vegetation biomass was 53+/-20 ton C ha(-1), 39\% of which was found in the root component and 61\% in above-ground components (trees, shrubs, grasses). Annual gross primary production was 20.8 ton C ha(-1), of which 27\% occurred in above-ground components and 73\% below-ground components. Net primary production was 11 ton C ha(-1) year(-1), of which 8.0 ton C ha(-1) (73\%) was contributed by below-ground net primary production and 3.0 ton C ha(-1) (27\%) by above-ground net primary production. Annual soil carbon efflux was 14.3 ton C ha(-1) year(-1). Approximately three-quarters of the carbon flux (above-ground, below-ground and total ecosystem) occur during the 5-6 months of the wet season. This savanna site is a carbon sink during the wet season, but becomes a weak source during the dry season. Annual net ecosystem production was 3.8 ton C ha(-1) year(-1).},

	Abstract = {Carbon budget of Siberian boreal forests is one of the largest uncertainties in the global carbon cycle under changing environment and then climate prediction. A coupled carbon cycle and fire regime model, which is applicable to simulate carbon budget of a fire-prone boreal forest in eastern Siberia, was developed in this paper. The carbon model consists of 10 pools and represents carbon dynamics including biomass burning, on the basis of an ecophysiological carbon cycle model (Sim-CYCLE). The fire model simulates fire behavior (ignition, expansion, and extinction) at a landscape scale with a spatially explicit cellular automaton, in a stochastic manner. Fire spread and burning intensity are parameterized as functions of temperature, moisture, and fuel availability, and ground fire and crown fire are dealt with separately. Interactions between the carbon cycle and fire behavior models are included, such that the carbon model simulates fuel dynamics and post-fire vegetation growth and the fire model simulates biomass burning (carbon dioxide emission, detritus production, and charcoal formation). The model was calibrated at a deciduous needle-leaved (larch) forest near Yakutsk, Russia (62 degrees N, 130 degrees E), in which Japanese researchers conducted surveys of carbon dynamics. The long-term simulation (1200 years) indicated that the mean fire interval of the larch forest was as short as 64 years, and most fires (94\% of burnt area) occurred as ground fires. Although crown fires were less frequent (6\% of burnt area), they exerted more severe impacts on carbon storage than ground fires. On average, the biomass burning released about 12\% of carbon fixed by plant photosynthesis directly and resulted in acceleration of carbon cycling of the boreal forest. Young post-fire forests exhibited higher photosynthetic activity and compensated for the loss of old stands. Sensitivity of the model simulation to variation in parameter values and environmental conditions was examined. Finally, the simulation analysis confirmed that the fire regime is an important ecosystem attribute, and that a coupled carbon and fire model is useful to investigate the carbon budget of boreal forest in eastern Siberia.

	Abstract = {In order to better assess the role of agriculture within the global climate-vegetation system, we present a model of the managed planetary land surface, Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land (LPJmL), which simulates biophysical and biogeochemical processes as well as productivity and yield of the most important crops worldwide, using a concept of crop functional types (CFTs). Based on the LPJ-Dynamic Global Vegetation Model, LPJmL simulates the transient changes in carbon and water cycles due to land use, the specific phenology and seasonal CO(2) fluxes of agricultural-dominated areas, and the production of crops and grazing land. It uses 13 CFTs (11 arable crops and two managed grass types), with specific parameterizations of phenology connected to leaf area development. Carbon is allocated daily towards four carbon pools, one being the yield-bearing storage organs. Management (irrigation, treatment of residues, intercropping) can be considered in order to capture their effect on productivity, on soil organic carbon and on carbon extracted from the ecosystem. For transient simulations for the 20th century, a global historical land use data set was developed, providing the annual cover fraction of the 13 CFTs, rain-fed and/or irrigated, within 0.5 degrees grid cells for the period 1901-2000, using published data on land use, crop distributions and irrigated areas. Several key results are compared with observations. The simulated spatial distribution of sowing dates for temperate cereals is comparable with the reported crop calendars. The simulated seasonal canopy development agrees better with satellite observations when actual cropland distribution is taken into account. Simulated yields for temperate cereals and maize compare well with FAO statistics. Monthly carbon fluxes measured at three agricultural sites also compare well with simulations. Global simulations indicate a similar to 24\% (respectively similar to 10\%) reduction in global vegetation (respectively soil) carbon due to agriculture, and 6-9 Pg C of yearly harvested biomass in the 1990s. In contrast to simulations of the potential natural vegetation showing the land biosphere to be an increasing carbon sink during the 20th century, LPJmL simulates a net carbon source until the 1970s (due to land use), and a small sink (mostly due to changing climate and CO(2)) after 1970. This is comparable with earlier LPJ simulations using a more simple land use scheme, and within the uncertainty range of estimates in the 1980s and 1990s. The fluxes attributed to land use change compare well with Houghton's estimates on the land use related fluxes until the 1970s, but then they begin to diverge, probably due to the different rates of deforestation considered. The simulated impacts of agriculture on the global water cycle for the 1990s are similar to 5\% (respectively similar to 20\%) reduction in transpiration (respectively interception), and similar to 44\% increase in evaporation. Global runoff, which includes a simple irrigation scheme, is practically not affected.},

	Abstract = {delta(13)C values in paleosols and fossil teeth have been used to document the expansion of C-4 plants in South Asia, Africa, and North America during the late Miocene. However, the exact timing and rate of expansion of C-4 vegetation is unclear outside the Old World because of a lack of high-resolution records. We present a high-resolution record from northwest Argentina in which the delta(13)C values of soil carbonate rise above a threshold of -8 parts per thousand, suggesting the presence of C-4 plants, starting at 7.3-6.7 Ma. delta(13)C values of fossil teeth from well dated sections in South and North America display a concomitant increase of C-4 plants in the diets of large herbivores. These results show that the late Miocene expansion of C-4 plants was global, but occurred at different rates in each region. While it is has been suggested that declining pCO(2) levels during the late Neogene caused C-4 plant expansion, climate change, such as an increase in summer-dominated rainfall regimes globally, is an alternative explanation. The delta(18)O soil carbonate records from South Asia, East Africa and now also northwest Argentina all show an increase of at least 3-4 parts per thousand in the late Neogene, either the result of climate change or of greater evaporation in average grassland soils.},

Factors or organisms that influence the survival of Acacia seedlings are likely to affect tree recruitment and therefore community and ecosystem dynamics. In African savannas, large mammals, especially elephants, have been considered the most important agents of mortality for adult trees, but their impacts on tree seedlings are not well known. We investigated the effects of large mammals on Acacia seedling survival by excluding large mammals from replicated 4-ha plots. Approximately twice as many seedlings were killed in plots with large mammals absent as on plots with large mammals present. Rodents and some invertebrates were more abundant on plots without large mammals and were responsible for these higher predation rates. Seedlings in areas with large mammals were more likely to die of desiccation; however, net seedling survival was approximately twice as high in the presence of large mammals. Our results indicate that large mammals may indirectly increase Acacia seedling survival and thus accelerate, rather than inhibit, tree recruitment.},

	Abstract = {Environmental conditions during the past 24 million years are thought to have been favourable for enhanced rates of atmospheric carbon dioxide drawdown by silicate chemical weathering(1-7). Proxy records indicate, however, that the Earth's atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations did not fall below about 200-250 parts per million during this period(8). The stabilization of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations near this minimum value suggests that strong negative feedback mechanisms inhibited further drawdown of atmospheric carbon dioxide by high rates of global silicate rock weathering. Here we investigate one possible negative feedback mechanism, occurring under relatively low carbon dioxide concentrations and in warm climates, that is related to terrestrial plant productivity and its role in the decomposition of silicate minerals(9-11). We use simulations of terrestrial and geochemical carbon cycles and available experimental evidence to show that vegetation activity in upland regions of active orogens was severely limited by near-starvation of carbon dioxide in combination with global warmth over this period. These conditions diminished biotic-driven silicate rock weathering and thereby attenuated an important long-term carbon dioxide sink. Although our modelling results are semi-quantitative and do not capture the full range of biogeochemical feedbacks that could influence the climate, our analysis indicates that the dynamic equilibrium between plants, climate and the geosphere probably buffered the minimum atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations over the past 24 million years.},

	Abstract = {We report the development of a new spatially explicit individual-based Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (SEIB-DGVM), the first DGVM that can simulate the local interactions among individual trees within a spatially explicit virtual forest. In the model, a sample plot is placed at each grid box, and then the growth, competition, and decay of each individual tree within each plot is calculated by considering the environmental conditions for that tree as it relates to the trees that surround it. Based on these parameters only, the model simulated time lags between climate change and vegetation change. This time lags elongated when original biome was forest, because existing trees prevent newly establish trees from receiving enough sunlight and space to quickly replace the original vegetation. This time lags also elongated when horizontal heterogeneity of sunlight distribution was ignored, indicating the potential importance of horizontal heterogeneity for predicting transitional behavior of vegetation under changing climate. on a local scale, the model reproduced climate zone-specific patterns of succession, carbon dynamics, and water flux, although on a global scale, simulations were not always in agreement with observations. Because the SEIB-DGVM was formulated to the scale at which field biologists work, the measurements of relevant parameters and data comparisons are relatively straightforward, and the model should enable more robust modeling of terrestrial ecosystems.

	Abstract = {The ecological differences between `shrubs' and `trees' are surprisingly poorly understood and clear ecological definitions of these two constructs do not exist. It is not clear whether a shrub is simply a small tree or whether shrubs represent a distinct life-history strategy. This question is of special interest in African savannas, where shrubs and trees often co-dominate, but are often treated uniformly as `woody plants' even though the tree to shrub ratio is an important determinant of ecosystem functioning. In this study we use data from a long-term fire experiment, together with a trait-based approach to test (i) if woody species usually classified as shrubs or trees in African savanna differ in key traits related to disturbance and resource use; and (ii) if these differences justify the interpretation of the two growth forms as distinct life-history strategies. We measured for 22 of the most common woody plant species of a South African savanna 27 plant traits related to plant architecture, life-history, leaf characteristics, photosynthesis and resprouting capacity. Furthermore we evaluated their performance during a long-term fire experiment. We found that woody plants authors call (i) shrubs; (ii) shrubs sometimes small trees; and (3) trees responded differently to long-term fire treatments. We additionally found significant differences in architecture, diameter-height-allometry, foliage density, resprouting vigour after fire, minimum fruiting height and foliar δ13C between these three woody plant types. We interpret these findings as evidence for at least two different life-history-strategies: an avoidance/adaptation strategy for shrubs (early reproduction + adaptation to minor disturbance) and an escape strategy for trees (promoted investment in height growth + delayed reproduction).},

At 53 carcasses for which we knew order of arrival, Turkey Vultures usually arrived first, Black Vultures second, and condors third. On the basis of our observations of 8,066 aggressive encounters between birds, we constructed dominance hierarchies by calculating the proportion of encounters won by an individual of one species, sex, or age during encounters with an individual of another species, sex, or age. Within each species there was a positive relationship between a bird's dominance and its age. In condors, males dominated females of the same age. Interspecific dominance was correlated positively with body mass. There are convergent similarities between the organizations of guilds of Old and New World vultures.},

We use stochastic calculus to derive the optimal population threshold at which individuals are harvested as well as the overall value of the population in the sense of the model. We show that except under extreme conditions, the population is never depleted in finite time, but remains in a stationary distribution which we find explicitly. Needless to say, our results prove that any strategy which totally depletes the population is sub-optimal. These results are much more precise than those previously obtained for this problem.},

@article{barbosa_above-ground_2005,
	Abstract = {Above-ground biomass (live + dead), was estimated pre- and post-burn in eight types of savanna ecosystem in Roraima, in the extreme northern part of the Brazilian Amazon. The objective was to investigate the stock of pre-burn above-ground carbon and its fate after experimental fires that were set during the dry season (December-March). The total biomass in each ecosystem was divided into two groups ("fine-fuels" and "trees and shrubs"), and the combustion factor and the concentration of carbon were determined for of each of the biomass components within these groups. The ecosystems with the lowest biomasses were the grasslands (1627-4045 kg ha(-1)), followed by parkland (6127-8038 kg ha(-1)) and open woodland savanna (10,246-11,731 kg ha(-1)). The percentage of "live biomass" was higher in the open woodland vegetation types (77.1-85.6\%), and lower in the grassland and parkland types (114-51.4\%). The total emitted carbon ("presumed release") in each ecosystem varied from 55 1 to 1474 kg C ha(-1). These results differ from those observed in the savannas of central Brazil (2909 kg C ha-1 emitted), which were used as the standard in the Brazilian national inventory of greenhouse-gas emissions for the burning of non-anthropic savannas. This suggests that the calculations of Brazilian emissions for savannas should be disaggregated by region instead of using standard national values. Savanna ecosystems in Amazonia, although defined phytoecologically in the same way as those of central Brazil (despite being separated by great geographical distances), possess fire dynamics of their own, implying differences in the emissions of greenhouse gases.

@article{barnes_ecological_2004,
	Abstract = {Scaling up from measurements made at small spatial and short temporal scales is a central challenge in the ecological and related sciences, where predictions at larger scales and over long time periods are required. It involves two quite distinct aspects: a formulation of a theoretical framework for calculating space-time averages, and an acquisition of data to support that framework. In this paper, we address the theoretical part of the question, and although our primary motivation was an understanding of carbon accounting our formulation is more general. To that end, we adopt a dynamical systems approach, and incorporate a new dynamical formulation of self-thinning. We show how to calculate rates of change for total (and average) plant dry mass, volume, and carbon, in terms of the properties of the individual plants. The results emphasize how local scale statistics (such as, variation in the size of individuals) lead to nonlinear variation at larger scales. Further, we describe how regular and stochastic disturbance can be readily incorporated into this framework. It is shown that stochastic disturbance at patch-scales, results in (to first approximation) regular disturbance at ecosystem scales, and hence can be formulated as such. We conclude that a dynamical formulation of self-thinning can be used as a generic framework for scaling ecological processes in space and time. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{reich_reconciling_1993,
	Abstract = {1. Data on leaf structure, physiology and life span from studies in contrasting plant life forms and biomes - alpine and lowland herbs in Austria, lowland temperate trees in Japan and lowland tropical trees in Venezuela - have led researchers to different conclusions about the relationships between leaf life span and other leaf traits. Results of the alpine/lowland study with herbs questioned the validity of a general theory of leaf life span, whereas results of the tropical forest study supported the theory and the temperate forest study fell in between. 2. In this paper I evaluate whether these different results reflect innate differences among plant life forms, biomes and/or communities in this respect, or whether these apparent discrepancies can be reconciled with one explanation. 3. When the data from all three studies were combined, leaf life span was well correlated (P {\textless} 0.001) with maximum mass and area-based net photosynthetic rate (r$^{\textrm{2}}$ = 0.86 and 0.70, respectively), specific leaf area (r$^{\textrm{2}}$ = 0.69) and leaf nitrogen concentration (r$^{\textrm{2}}$ = 0.74), and the relationships were predicted well by equations previously generated in an independent study. Data for alpine and lowland herbs generally fit along the regression lines as well as data from either the temperate or tropical trees. 4. These data thus show that within plant communities where most species have relatively similar leaf traits, minimal or weak relationships among leaf traits may occur, yet without departing from broad general relationships. These results support the idea of a relatively fixed interdependence among leaf life span, specific leaf area, net photosynthetic rate and leaf nitrogen concentration across broad gradients of species, plant life forms and environments.},

@article{hoffmann_constraints_2004,
	Abstract = {Tropical savannas and closed forests are characterized by distinct tree communities, with most species occurring almost exclusively in only one of the two environments. The ecology of these two groups of species will largely determine the structure and dynamics of the savanna-forest boundary, but little is known about the ecological and physiological differences that might control their distributions. We performed field and nursery experiments to compare seedling establishment success, predawn leaf water potential, biomass allocation, and root carbohydrate concentration of congeneric species, each composed of one savanna species and one forest species. Seedling establishment of savanna and forest species responded differently to vegetation cover, with forest species having lowest establishment success in the open savanna and savanna species having lowest success in forest. Subsequent survival followed similar patterns, resulting in even greater differences in cumulative success. The low survival of forest species in the savanna appears related to drought stress, as seedlings of forest species had lower predawn leaf water potential than savanna species. Seedlings of savanna species had greater root: shoot ratios and root total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) concentration, particularly among evergreen genera. Among evergreen genera, root TNC per shoot mass, which may largely determine resprout capacity, was seven times higher in savanna species than forest species. Although water availability and microclimate may reduce the success of forest species, these factors appear unable to completely exclude forest seedling establishment in savanna. Fire, on the other hand, appears to be a much more absolute constraint to success of forest species in savanna.},

The coupled regional model simulation projects a 70\% reduction in the extent of the Amazon rain forest by the end of the twenty-first century and a large eastward expansion of the caatinga vegetation that is prominent in the Nordeste region of Brazil today. These changes in vegetation are related to reductions in annual mean rainfall and a modification of the seasonal cycle that are associated with a weakening of tropical circulation systems.},

	Abstract = {We analyze daily mean, variability, and frequency of precipitation in two continuous 3 1/2 year long climate simulations over the continental U.S., one for present conditions and one for conditions under doubled carbon dioxide concentration, conducted with a regional climate model (RegCM) nested in a general circulation model (GCM). The purpose of the work is to analyze model errors and limitations in greater detail than previously done and to calculate quantities that eventually will be used to form climate change scenarios that account for changes in daily variability of precipitation. The models used are a version of the NCAR Community Climate Model (CCM) and the climate version (RegCM) of the NCAR/Penn State mesoscale model (MM4) at 60 km horizontal grid point spacing. Model output is compared with a 30-year daily observational data set for mainly two regions of the U.S.: the Northwest, and the central Great Plains. Statistics compared include mean daily precipitation, mean daily intensity, frequency, transition probabilities, quantiles of precipitation intensity, and interquartile ranges. We discuss how different measures of daily precipitation lead to different conclusions about the quality of the control run. For example, good agreement between model and observed data regarding mean daily precipitation usually results from compensating errors in the intensity and frequency fields (too high frequency and too low intensity). We analyze how detailed topographic features of the RegCM enhance the simulation of daily precipitation compared to the CCM simulation. In general, errors in all measures are smallest at the Northwest grid points, and the damping of the seasonal cycle of mean daily precipitation from the coast to inland Oregon is basically well reproduced. However, some errors in the frequency and intensity fields can be traced to inadequate representation of topography, even with a horizontal resolution of 60 km, Differences in the control and doubled CO, runs (for both RegCM and CCM) for these regions are also presented. The most significant changes for the RegCM grid points is increased variability of daily precipitation under doubled CO, conditions. Areas with significant changes (both increases and decreases) of precipitation frequency and intensity are found, There are some areas where frequency decreases, but precipitation mean daily amounts increase. Such changes, which would be masked by more traditional analyses of precipitation change, are important from a climate impacts point of view. The limitations on the analyses posed by small sample sizes are discussed.},

@article{blanco_feedbacks_2014,
	Abstract = {Vegetation changes, such as shrub encroachment and forest expansion over grasslands, prairies and savannas have been related to changes in climatic (mainly rainfall and temperature) and atmospheric conditions (CO2 concentration). However, a longstanding question in ecology is how mosaics of forests and open-canopy ecosystems could persist over millennia in sites where climatic conditions favor forests. Here we tested the influence of interactions between grass-tree competition, environmental heterogeneity (topography), seed dispersal, initial density and spatial aggregation of vegetation patches and disturbance behavior (fire) on the long-term coexistence of forests and grasslands in South Brazil. For this, we incorporated the adaptive dynamic global vegetation model (aDGVM) into a spatially explicit modeling approach (2D-aDGVM). Our results showed that recurrent disturbance related to grasses such as fires plays a key role in maintaining the long-term coexistence of forests and grasslands, mainly through feedbacks between disturbance frequency and grass biomass. Topographic heterogeneity affected the rate of forest expansion by adding spatio-temporal variability in vegetation-fire feedbacks. However, the spatial pattern and connectivity of fire-prone (grasslands) and fire-sensitive (forest) vegetation patches were more important to maintain the long-term coexistence of both alternative vegetation states than the initial proportion of forest and grasslands patches. The model is the first individual-based DGVM to consider the combined effects of topography, seed dispersal and fire spread behavior in a spatially explicit approach.},

	Abstract = {Background and Aims When ecologically important plant traits are correlated they may be said to constitute an ecological `strategy' dimension. Through identifying these dimensions and understanding their inter-relationships we gain insight into why particular trait combinations are favoured over others and into the implications of trait differences among species. Here we investigated relationships among several traits, and thus the strategy dimensions they represented, across 2134 woody species from seven Neotropical forests.
Methods Six traits were studied: specific leaf area (SLA), the average size of leaves, seed and fruit, typical maximum plant height, and wood density (WD). Trait relationships were quantified across species at each individual forest as well as across the dataset as a whole. `Phylogenetic' analyses were used to test for correlations among evolutionary trait-divergences and to ascertain whether interspecific relationships were biased by strong taxonomic patterning in the traits.
Key Results The interspecific and phylogenetic analyses yielded congruent results. Seed and fruit size were expected, and confirmed, to be tightly related. As expected, plant height was correlated with each of seed and fruit size, albeit weakly. Weak support was found for an expected positive relationship between leaf and fruit size. The prediction that SLA and WD would be negatively correlated was not supported. Otherwise the traits were predicted to be largely unrelated, being representatives of putatively independent strategy dimensions. This was indeed the case, although WD was consistently, negatively related to leaf size.
Conclusions The dimensions represented by SLA, seed/fruit size and leaf size were essentially independent and thus conveyed largely independent information about plant strategies. To a lesser extent the same was true for plant height and WD. Our tentative explanation for negative WD--leaf size relationships, now also known from other habitats, is that the traits are indirectly linked via plant hydraulics.},

	Abstract = {In C3 plants, CO2 concentrations drop considerably along mesophyll diffusion pathways from substomatal cavities to chloroplasts where CO2 assimilation occurs. Global carbon cycle models have not explicitly represented this internal drawdown and therefore overestimate CO2 available for carboxylation and underestimate photosynthetic responsiveness to atmospheric CO2. An explicit consideration of mesophyll diffusion increases the modeled cumulative CO2 fertilization effect (CFE) for global gross primary production (GPP) from 915 to 1,057 PgC for the period of 1901--2010. This increase represents a 16\% correction, which is large enough to explain the persistent overestimation of growth rates of historical atmospheric CO2 by Earth system models. Without this correction, the CFE for global GPP is underestimated by 0.05 PgC/y/ppm. This finding implies that the contemporary terrestrial biosphere is more CO2 limited than previously thought.},

The populations readily recover, but the recolonisation rates and other ecological effects of the culls have not been fully examined. Monthly live trapping programmes were used to monitor the grey squirrel populations in two woodlands.Culls, where as many grey squirrels as possible were removed by trapping,were conducted on five occasions; three in one woodland and two in the other.The squirrel populations recovered within ten weeks in four of the five culls. Post-cull populations tended to consist of unmarked adult squirrels that had entered from outside the woodland.One cull attempted in the autumn was not a success, as capture rates were low and the population had returned to its pre-cull levels within three weeks.Many young squirrels entered the population following this cull. Some long-term repercussions of the culls were evident, even after the population density had recovered. The age profile changed,with the removal of breeding females reducing the numbers of young squirrels for the following year.Breeding levels were also reduced as the recolonising populations were slow to start breeding.Home ranges of surviving squirrels expanded if the population density remained at a reduced level,and core areas often shifted following a cull.},

@article{cafazzo_dominance_2010,
	Abstract = {Current knowledge about social behavior of free-ranging domestic dogs is scarce, and the possibility that they could form stable social groups has been highly debated. We investigated the existence of a social-dominance hierarchy in a free-ranging group of domestic dogs. We quantified the pattern of dyadic exchange of a number of behaviors to examine to what extent each behavior fits a linear rank-order model. We distinguished among agonistic dominance, formal dominance, and competitive ability. The agonistic-dominance hierarchy in the study group shows significant and substantial linearity. As in random assortments of captive wolves, there is a prominent but nonexclusive male agonistic dominance in each age class. The agonistic rank-order correlates positively and significantly with age. Submissive-affiliative behavior fulfills the criteria of formal submission signals; nevertheless, it was not observed among all dogs, and thus, it is not useful to order the dogs in a consistent linear rank. Agonistic-dominance relationships in the dog group remain stable across different competitive contexts and to the behaviors considered. Some individuals gain access to food prevailing over other dogs during competitions. Access to food resources is predicted reasonably well by agonistic rank order: High-ranking individuals have the priority of access. The findings of this research contradict the notion that free-ranging dogs are "asocial" animals and agree with other studies suggesting that long-term social bonds exist within free-ranging dog groups.},

To improve our understanding of the ecological and physiological differences between tropical savanna and forest trees, we compared leaf traits of species native to savanna and gallery (riverine) forests in the Cerrado region of central Brazil. * 2Congeneric species pairs from 14 different taxonomic families were studied, each with a savanna species and a forest species present at the study site. Only individuals growing in savanna conditions under full sun were studied. We measured foliar nutrients, δ13C, δ15N and specific leaf area (SLA: leaf area per unit leaf mass). We used phylogenetically independent contrasts to compare savanna and forest species and to test for correlations among species traits. * 3Overall, leaves of forest species had 17\% higher N concentration, 32\% higher P concentration, and 37\% higher K concentration, despite growing in similar soils. Concentrations of all three elements were strongly and positively correlated with SLA. * 4Forest species had 52\% greater SLA, on average, than savanna species, which accounts for the higher foliar nutrient concentrations of these species. * 5Savanna species had higher δ13C values than forest species, indicating higher water-use efficiency. The SLA was negatively correlated with δ13C, suggesting that SLA may also account for the higher water-use efficiency of savanna species. * 6There was no difference in foliar δ15N between savanna and forest species, but foliar δ15N was negatively correlated with soil pH. * 7These results contribute to recent studies showing that tropical savanna and forest species represent two distinct functional types, with large differences in ecology and physiology, that have important consequences for the dynamics of savanna--forest boundaries.},

@article{scheiter_next-generation_2013,
	Abstract = {Summary * Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) are powerful tools to project past, current and future vegetation patterns and associated biogeochemical cycles. However, most models are limited by how they define vegetation and by their simplistic representation of competition. * We discuss how concepts from community assembly theory and coexistence theory can help to improve vegetation models. We further present a trait- and individual-based vegetation model (aDGVM2) that allows individual plants to adopt a unique combination of trait values. These traits define how individual plants grow and compete. A genetic optimization algorithm is used to simulate trait inheritance and reproductive isolation between individuals. These model properties allow the assembly of plant communities that are adapted to a site's biotic and abiotic conditions. * The aDGVM2 simulates how environmental conditions influence the trait spectra of plant communities; that fire selects for traits that enhance fire protection and reduces trait diversity; and the emergence of life-history strategies that are suggestive of colonization--competition trade-offs. * The aDGVM2 deals with functional diversity and competition fundamentally differently from current DGVMs. This approach may yield novel insights as to how vegetation may respond to climate change and we believe it could foster collaborations between functional plant biologists and vegetation modellers.},

The model was interfaced to a geographic information system (GIS) and used to generate a numerical vegetation map, on the basis of digital maps of 12 environmental variables including climatic conditions (temperature and precipitation), topography (elevation, slope, aspect), and soil parameters (soil pH and physical soil parameters). The predicted distribution of forest communities was compared with several vegetation maps, prepared for some subregions of Switzerland by means of traditional field methods. Similarity ranged from 50 to 80 \%, depending on the community type, level of vegetational hierarchy and the geographical region. The current resolution and accuracy of the simulated vegetation map allows us to study the vegetational patterns on the level of the entire country or its major geographical and climatic regions. The simulated vegetation map is potentially an important tool in ecological risk assessment studies concerning the possible impacts of climate change on the ecological potential of forest sites and biological diversity of forest communities.},

Fecundity may depend on the type of species but is density independent. Depending on the relative strengths of interspecific and intraspecific competition and on the fecundities, the parameter space for the classical model is divided into regions where either coexistence, competitive exclusion or founder control occur. The spatial version is a continuous time Markov profess in which individuals are located on the d-dimensional integer lattice. Their dynamics are described by a set of local rules which have the same components as the classical model. Our main results for the spatial stochastic version can be summarized as follows. Local competitive interactions between species result in (1) a reduction of the parameter region where coexistence occurs in the classical model, (2) a reduction of the parameter region where founder control occurs in the classical model, and (3) spatial segregation of the two species in parts of the parameter region where the classical model predicts coexistence.},

As a result of new empirical examples and theory, it is now generally accepted that sympatric speciation has occurred in at least a few instances, and is theoretically plausible. Instead, debate has shifted to whether sympatric speciation is common, and whether models' assumptions are generally met in nature. The relative frequency of sympatric speciation will be difficult to resolve, because biogeographic changes have obscured geographical patterns underlying many past speciation events. In contrast, progress is being made on evaluating the empirical validity of key theoretical conditions for sympatric speciation. Disruptive selection and direct selection on mating traits, which should facilitate sympatric speciation, are biologically well supported. Conversely, costs to assortative mating are also widely documented, but inhibit speciation. Evaluating the joint incidence of these key factors may illuminate why sympatric speciation appears to be relatively uncommon.},

@article{clark_fecundity_2004,
	Abstract = {Colonization-competition trade-offs represent a stabilizing mechanism that is thought to maintain diversity of forest trees. If so, then early-successional species should benefit from high capacity factors that contribute to seed production and dispersal, particularly the many types of stochasticity that contribute to fecundity data. We develop a hierarchical Bayes modeling structure, and we use it to estimate fecundity schedules from the two types of data that ecologists typically collect, including seed-trap counts and observations of tree status. The posterior density is obtained using Markov-chain Monte Carlo techniques. The flexible structure yields estimates of size and covariate effects on seed production, variability associated with population heterogeneity, and interannual stochasticity (variability and serial autocorrelation), sex ratio, and dispersal. It admits the errors in data associated with the ability to accurately recognize tree status and process misspecification. We estimate year-by-year seed-production rates for all individuals in each of nine sample stands from two regions and up to I I years. A rich characterization of differences among species and relationships among individuals allows evaluation of a number of hypotheses related to masting, effective population sizes, and location and covariate effects. It demonstrates large bias in previous methods. We focus on implications for colonization-competition and a related hypothesis, the successional niche-trade-offs in the capacity to exploit high resource availability in early successional environments vs. the capacity to survive low-resource conditions late in succession. Contrary to predictions of trade-off hypotheses, we find no relationship between successional status and fecundity, dispersal, or expected arrivals at distant sites. Results suggest a mechanism for maintenance of diversity that may be more general than colonization-competition and successional niches. High variability and strong individual effects (variability within populations) generate massive stochasticity in recruitment that, when combined with "storage," may provide a stabilizing mechanism. The storage effect stabilizes diversity when species differences ensure that responses to stochasticity are not highly correlated among species. Process variability and individual effects mean that many species have the advantage at different times and places even in the absence of "deterministic" trade-offs. Not only does colonization vary among species, but also individual behavior is highly stochastic and weakly correlated among members of the-same population. Although these factors are the dominant sources of variability in data sets (substantially larger than the deterministic relationships typically examined), they have not been not included in the models that ecologists have used to evaluate mechanisms of species coexistence (e.g., even individual-based models lack random individual effects). Recognition of the mechanisms of coexistence requires not only heuristic models that capture the principal sources of stochasticity, but also data-modeling techniques that allow for their estimation.},

@article{polley_growth_2002,
	Abstract = {Traits that promote rapid growth and seedling recruitment when water is plentiful may become a liability when seedlings encounter drought. We tested the hypothesis that CO2 enrichment reinforces any tradeoff between growth rate and drought tolerance by exaggerating interspecific differences in maximum relative growth rate (RGR) and survivorship of drought among seedlings of five woody legumes. We studied invasive species of grasslands that differ in distribution along a rainfall gradient. Survivorship of drought at ambient CO2 concentration ([CO2]) was negatively related to RGR in well-watered seedlings in one of two experiments, but the relationship was weak because interspecific differences in RGR were small. Contrary to our hypothesis, there was no significant relationship among well-watered seedlings between RGR at ambient [CO2] and either the relative or absolute increase in RGR at elevated [CO2]. As predicted, however, CO2 enrichment reinforced interspecific differences in survivorship of seedlings exposed to similar rates of soil water depletion. Doubling [CO2] improved seedling survivorship of the most drought-tolerant species throughout the period of soil water depletion, but did not consistently affect survivorship of more drought-sensitive species. Midday xylem pressure potentials of drought-treated seedlings were less negative at elevated [CO2] than at ambient [CO2], but no other measured trait was consistently correlated with improved survivorship at high [CO2]. Carbon dioxide enrichment may not reinforce species differences in RGR, but could exaggerate interspecific differences in drought tolerance.

	Abstract = {Increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2 ) are likely to affect the trophic relationships that exist between plants, their herbivores and the herbivores' natural enemies. This study takes advantage of an open-top CO2 fertilization experiment in a Florida scrub oak community at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, consisting of eight chambers supplied with ambient CO2 (360 ppm) and eight chambers supplied with elevated CO2 (710 ppm). We examined the effects of elevated CO2 on herbivore densities and levels of leaf consumption, rates of herbivore attack by natural enemies and effects on leaf abscission. Cumulative levels of herbivores and herbivore damage were significantly lower in elevated CO2 than in ambient CO2 . This may be because leaf nitrogen levels are lower in elevated CO2 . More herbivores die of host plant-induced death {\textless}linkr rid="q1"{\textgreater} {\textless}/linkr{\textgreater}in elevated CO2 than in ambient CO2 . Attack rates of herbivores by parasitoids are also higher in elevated CO2 , possibly because herbivores need to feed for a longer time in order to accrue sufficient nitrogen (N), thus exposing themselves longer to natural enemies. Insect herbivores cause an increase in abscission rates of leaves throughout the year. Because of the lower insect density in elevated CO2 , we thought, abscission rates would be lower in these chambers. However, abscission rates were significantly higher in elevated CO2 . Thus, the direct effects of elevated CO2 on abscission are greater than the indirect effects on abscission mediated via lower insect densities. A consequence of increased leaf abscission in elevated CO2 is that nutrient deposition rates to the soil surface are accelerated.},

	Abstract = {We investigated how water transport capacity, wood density and wood anatomy were related to leaf photosynthetic traits in two lowland forests in Panama. Leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity (k L) of upper branches was positively correlated with maximum rates of net CO2 assimilation per unit leaf area (A area) and stomatal conductance (g s) across 20 species of canopy trees. Maximum k L showed stronger correlation with A area than initial k L suggesting that allocation to photosynthetic potential is proportional to maximum water transport capacity. Terminal branch k L was negatively correlated with A area/g s and positively correlated with photosynthesis per unit N, indicating a trade-off of efficient use of water against efficient use of N in photosynthesis as water transport efficiency varied. Specific hydraulic conductivity calculated from xylem anatomical characteristics (k theoretical) was positively related to A area and k L, consistent with relationships among physiological measurements. Branch wood density was negatively correlated with wood water storage at saturation, k L, A area, net CO2 assimilation per unit leaf mass (A mass), and minimum leaf water potential measured on covered leaves, suggesting that wood density constrains physiological function to specific operating ranges. Kinetic and static indices of branch water transport capacity thus exhibit considerable co-ordination with allocation to potential carbon gain. Our results indicate that understanding tree hydraulic architecture provides added insights to comparisons of leaf level measurements among species, and links photosynthetic allocation patterns with branch hydraulic processes.},

Mortality data from 21 ha of permanent inventory plots, monitored for 10-15 years, were used to select dead trees for sampling. Measured rate constants varied by over 1.5 orders of magnitude (0.015-0.67 year(-1)), averaging 0.19 year(-1) with predicted error of 0.026 year. Wood density and bole diameter were significantly and inversely correlated with rate constants. A tree of average biomass was predicted to decompose at 0.17 year(-1). Based on mortality data, an average of 7.0 trees ha(-1) year(-1) died producing 3.6 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) of coarse litter ({\textgreater}10 cm diameter). Mean coarse litter standing-stocks were predicted to be 21 Mg ha(-1) with a mean residence time of 5.9 years, and a maximum mean carbon flux to the atmosphere of 1.8 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). Total litter is estimated to be partitioned into 16\% fine wood, 30\% coarse wood, and 54\% non-woody litter (e.g., leaves, fruits, flowers). Decomposition rate constants for coarse litter were compiled from 20 globally distributed studies. Rates were highly correlated with mean annual temperature, giving a respiration quotient (Q(10)) of 2.4 (10 degrees C-1).},

We utilize 18 ASTER scenes distributed throughout the Southern Africa region covering the time period 5 August 2001 to 6 October 2001. The MODIS fire product is characterized through the use of logistic regression models to establish a relationship between the binary MODIS 'fire'/'no fire' product and summary statistics derived from ASTER data over the coincident MODIS pixel. Probabilities of detection are determined as a function of the total number of ASTER fires and Moran's I, a measure of the spatial heterogeneity of fires within the MODIS pixel. The statistical analysis is done for versions 3 and 4 of the MODIS fire-detection algorithm. It is shown that the algorithm changes have a positive effect on the fire-product accuracy.},

@article{rowland_death_2015,
	Abstract = {Drought threatens tropical rainforests over seasonal to decadal timescales, but the drivers of tree mortality following drought remain poorly understood. It has been suggested that reduced availability of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) critically increases mortality risk through insufficient carbon supply to metabolism (`carbon starvation'). However, little is known about how NSC stores are affected by drought, especially over the long term, and whether they are more important than hydraulic processes in determining drought-induced mortality. Using data from the world's longest-running experimental drought study in tropical rainforest (in the Brazilian Amazon), we test whether carbon starvation or deterioration of the water-conducting pathways from soil to leaf trigger tree mortality. Biomass loss from mortality in the experimentally droughted forest increased substantially after {\textgreater}10 years of reduced soil moisture availability. The mortality signal was dominated by the death of large trees, which were at a much greater risk of hydraulic deterioration than smaller trees. However, we find no evidence that the droughted trees suffered carbon starvation, as their NSC concentrations were similar to those of non-droughted trees, and growth rates did not decline in either living or dying trees. Our results indicate that hydraulics, rather than carbon starvation, triggers tree death from drought in tropical rainforest.},

The impact of such elephant-mediated habitat change on biodiversity in African game reserves has seldom been measured. We examined species richness of woody plants, birds, bats, mantises and ants in reserves where elephants had destroyed the miombo woodland and in adjacent but intact miombo woodlands outside the reserves. Species richness of woodland birds and ants was significantly lower where elephants had removed the tree canopy. Our findings may have important policy implications for conserving biodiversity in many African reserves in the face of rapidly growing elephant populations (approximately 5\% per annum). The problem is further compounded by international public pressures against reducing elephant densities within game reserves while, outside these protected areas, savanna woodlands and their associated faunas are being lost to agriculture. Where then will refugia for habitat-sensitive species exist if not within the region's largest protected areas?},

	Abstract = {Detrended Canonical Correspondence Analysis (DCCA) was used to describe the relationship between savanna environments and vegetation community composition in the Orinoco Basin. TWINSPAN derived three major types of savanna vegetation, each with its own Aoristic and physiognomic features. The first group reflected a plant association with species Trachypogon occurring in moderately infertile soils with low water availability and high bulk density. This group is distributed mostly on hilltops and dissected plains of the northern Orinoco savannas. The second group has the highest species diversity in habitats occurring in the northern Orinoco with extremely infertile soils. The third group, on the other hand, has a considerable number of species belonging to the leguminosae and Cyperaceae families and linked to the habitats of the eastern Colombian savannas with the highest soil water availability, a shorter dry season and higher precipitation. The regional analysis of the Orinoco savannas suggests edaphic controls to be important. Changes in the underlying geology have affected topography and soil formation, which results in variation in water and nutrient status. The moisture regime and hydrological features are acting as the major regional determinants, while nutrient levels and distinctive surface soil properties provide the subregional determinants. The local boundary, at any given site, is strongly determined by nutrient shortage and acidity. Also, biogeographic and floristic considerations were taken into account to explain differences in species composition.},

@article{clark_estimating_2003,
	Abstract = {Recent literature on plant population spread advocates quantification of long-distance dispersal (LDD). These estimates could provide insights into rates of migration in response to climate change and rates of alien invasions. LDD information is not available for parameterization of current models because it is hard to obtain. We combine a new stochastic model with a flexible framework that permits assimilation of evidence that might be derived from a range of sources. Results are consistent with the prediction of traditional diffusion that population spread has a finite asymptotic velocity. Unlike traditional diffusion, spread is not well described by the mean; it is erratic. In contrast with deterministic models, our results show that inherent uncertainty, rather than parameter sensitivity, thwarts informative forecasts of spread velocity. Analysis shows that, because LDD is inherently unpredictable, even full knowledge of LDD parameters might not provide informative estimates of velocity for populations characterized by LDD. Although predictive distributions are too broad to provide precise estimates of spread rate, they are valuable for comparing spread potential among species and for identifying potential for invasion. Using combinations of dispersal data and the estimates provided by dispersal biologists that derive from multiple sources, the model predicts spread rates that are much slower than those from traditional (deterministic) fat-tailed models and from simulation models of spread, but for different reasons. Deterministic fat-tailed models overestimate spread rate, because they assume that fractions of individuals can rapidly occupy distant sites. Stochastic models recognize that distant colonization is limited to discrete individuals. Stochastic simulations of plant migration overestimate migration of trees, because they typically assume values of R-0 that are too large.},

	Abstract = {Quantifying the equilibrium response of global temperatures to an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations is one of the cornerstones of climate research. Components of the Earth's climate system that vary over long timescales, such as ice sheets and vegetation, could have an important effect on this temperature sensitivity, but have often been neglected. Here we use a coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model to simulate the climate of the mid-Pliocene warm period (about three million years ago), and analyse the forcings and feedbacks that contributed to the relatively warm temperatures. Furthermore, we compare our simulation with proxy records of mid-Pliocene sea surface temperature. Taking these lines of evidence together, we estimate that the response of the Earth system to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations is 30-50\% greater than the response based on those fast-adjusting components of the climate system that are used traditionally to estimate climate sensitivity. We conclude that targets for the long-term stabilization of atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations aimed at preventing a dangerous human interference with the climate system should take into account this higher sensitivity of the Earth system.},

Yet it remains unclear how anatomical elements linked to different wood functions contribute to variation in WSG in branches and roots across tropical forests. * We examined WSG and wood anatomy in white sand, clay terra firme and seasonally flooded forests in French Guiana, spanning broad environmental gradients found throughout Amazonia. We measured 15 traits relating to branches and small woody roots in 113 species representing the 15 most abundant species in each habitat and representative species from seven monophyletic lineages occurring in all habitats. * Fiber traits appear to be major determinants of WSG, independent of vessel traits, in branches and roots. Fiber traits and branch and root WSG increased from seasonally flooded species to clay terra firme species and lastly to white sand species. Branch and root wood traits were strongly phylogenetically constrained. Lineages differed in wood design, but exhibited similar variation in wood structure across habitats. * We conclude that tropical trees can invest differently in support and transport to respond to environmental conditions. Wind disturbance and drought stress represent significant filters driving tree distribution of Amazonian forests; hence we suggest that biophysical explanations should receive more attention.},

@article{venevsky_simulating_2002,
	Abstract = {A new fire model is proposed which estimates areas burnt on a macro-scale (10-100 km). It consists of three parts: evaluation of fire danger due to climatic conditions, estimation of the number of fires and the extent of the area burnt. The model can operate on three time steps, daily, monthly and yearly, and interacts with a Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (DGVM), thereby providing an important forcing for natural competition. Fire danger is related to number of dry days and amplitude of daily temperature during these days. The number of fires during fire days varies with human population density. Areas burnt are calculated based on average wind speed, available fuel and fire duration. The model has been incorporated into the Lund-Potsdam-Jena Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (LPJ-DGVM) and has been tested for peninsular Spain. LPJ-DGVM was modified to allow bi-directional feedback between fire disturbance and vegetation dynamics. The number of fires and areas burnt were simulated for the period 1974-94 and compared against observations. The model produced realistic results, which are well correlated, both spatially and temporally, with the fire statistics. Therefore, a relatively simple mechanistic fire model can be used to reproduce fire regime patterns in human- dominated ecosystems over a large region and a long time period.},

	Abstract = {Explaining the origin and maintenance of biodiversity is critical for understanding the potential consequences of present-day environmental change on ecological communities, as well as the evolutionary history of ecosystems in the Earth's past. Much effort in theoretical ecology has focused on identifying mechanisms that promote stable coexistence of species at equilibrium. However, in a consumer-resource model of competition along an environmental gradient, high-diversity assemblages have the potential to persist in non-equilibrium states for millions of generations with very little species loss. Species' populations in such competitively accommodated communities show slow drift; if disrupted, they rapidly reorganize into alternative persistent states. Fossil examples of prolonged ecological stability lasting 1-5 Myr punctuated by rapid reorganization (e. g. brachiopods from the Permian Reef of west Texas) suggest that some palaeocommunities represent a record of periodically disrupted transient states rather than stable equilibria. The similarity between the theoretical results reported here and palaeontological data suggests that the maintenance of high-diversity communities, both in the past and present, may reflect long-duration, non-equilibrium transient dynamics. If so, this has implications for the response of such communities to present-day environmental change, as well as for the evolution of lineages in such systems.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Multispecies allometric models to predict grass biomass may increase field study efficiency by eliminating the need for species-specific data. We used field measurements during two growing seasons to develop single-species and multispecies regression models predicting the current year's aboveground biomass for eight common cespitose grass species. Simple and stepwise regression analyses were based on natural log expressions of biomass, basal diameter, and height, and a dummy variable expression of grazing history. Basal diameter had the strongest relationship with biomass among single-species (adjusted R2  =  0.80 to 0.91) and multispecies (adjusted R2  =  0.85) models. Regression slopes (b) for diameter among single-species (b  =  1.01 to 1.49) and the multispecies (b  =  1.25) models suggests that biomass will double when diameter increases ∼75\%. Height and grazing history added little predictive value when diameter was already in the model. When applied to actual populations, biomass estimates from multispecies models were within 3--29\% of estimates from the single-species models. Although the multispecies biomass--size relationship was robust across the cespitose life-form, users should be cautious about applying our equations to different locations, plant sizes, and population size-structures. ,  Resumen Los modelos alom{\'e}tricos de especies m{\'u}ltiples para predecir biomasa en gram{\'\i}neas pueden incrementar la eficiencia del estudio en campo, eliminando la necesidad de datos propios de cada especie.

@article{saatchi_impact_2011,
	Abstract = {Understanding the spatial variability of tropical forest structure and its impact on the radar estimation of aboveground biomass (AGB) is important to assess the scale and accuracy of mapping AGB with future low frequency radar missions. We used forest inventory plots in old growth, secondary succession, and forest plantations at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica to examine the spatial variability of AGB and its impact on the L-band and P-band polarimetric radar estimation of AGB at multiple spatial scales. Field estimation of AGB was determined from tree size measurements and an allometric equation developed for tropical wet forests. The field data showed very high spatial variability of forest structure with no spatial dependence at a scale above 11 m in old-growth forest. Plot sizes of greater than 0.25 ha reduced the coefficients of variation in AGB to below 20\% and yielded a stationary and normal distribution of AGB over the landscape. Radar backscatter measurements at all polarization channels were strongly positively correlated with AGB at three scales of 0.25 ha, 0.5 ha, and 1.0 ha. Among these measurements, PHV and LHV showed strong sensitivity to AGB \&lt; 300 Mg ha− 1 and AGB \&lt; 150 Mg ha− 1 respectively at the 1.0 ha scale. The sensitivity varied across forest types because of differences in the effects of forest canopy and gap structure on radar attenuation and scattering. Spatial variability of structure and speckle noise in radar measurements contributed equally to degrading the sensitivity of the radar measurements to AGB at spatial scales less than 1.0 ha. By using algorithms based on polarized radar backscatter, we estimated AGB with RMSE = 22.6 Mg ha− 1 for AGB \&lt; 300 Mg ha− 1 at P-band and RMSE = 23.8 Mg ha− 1 for AGB \&lt; 150 Mg ha− 1 at L-band and with the accuracy optimized at 1-ha scale within 95\% confidence interval. By adding the forest height, estimated from the C-band Interferometry data as an independent variable to the algorithm, the AGB estimation improved beyond the backscatter sensitivity by 20\% at P-band and 40\% at L-band. The results suggested the estimation of AGB can be improved substantially from the fusion of lidar or InSAR derived forest height with the polarimetric backscatter.},

@article{novoplansky_developmental_2002,
	Abstract = {There has been a surge of interest in phenotypic plasticity in the last two decades. Most studies, however, are being carried out within relatively narrow disciplinary frameworks. Consequently, researchers differ not only in their scientific agenda; they often use different terminologies and conceptual frameworks even when studying the very same phenomena. The diversity of approaches has often generated parallel bodies of theory on subjects that can be best understood in broader interdisciplinary terms. This special issue points out the differences between the concepts and questions that are characteristic of various approaches. Bridging all gulfs may be impossible and not necessarily desirable, yet, awareness of the varied approaches should be instrumental in promoting interdisciplinary advances. It is the contribution to such awareness that is the major purpose of this special issue, and for this reason it deals with molecular, physiological, ecological and evolutionary approaches to the study of developmental plasticity. So as to focus the discussion, six topics have been selected, ranging from the fundamental essence of developmental plasticity to its implications to ecology and evolution. These topics were considered by scholars who were chosen for the diversity of their research, not only their expertise. Rather than a comprehensive body of theory, the current issue thus seeks the diversity of opinions on the discussed topics. It is hoped that the confrontation, in its original Latin sense, which includes bringing together and discussion, of scholars who are studying these phenomena at very different levels and from different points of view will generate new insights and promote future interdisciplinary research.},

	Abstract = {The equilibrium terrestrial biosphere model BIOME3 simulates vegetation distribution and biogeochemistry, and couples vegetation distribution directly to biogeochemistry. Model inputs consist of latitude, soil texture class, and monthly climate (temperature, precipitation, and sunshine) data on a 0.5$\,^{\circ}$ grid. Ecophysiological constraints determine which plant functional types (PFTs) may potentially occur. A coupled carbon and water flux model is then used to calculate, for each PFT, the leaf area index (LAI) that maximizes net primary production (NPP), subject to the constraint that NPP must be sufficient to maintain this LAI. Competition between PFTs is simulated by using the optimal NPP of each PFT as an index of competitiveness, with additional rules to approximate the dynamic equilibrium between natural disturbance and succession driven by light competition. Model output consists of a quantitative vegetation state description in terms of the dominant PFT, secondary PFTs present, and the total LAI and NPP for the ecosystem. Canopy conductance is treated as a function of the calculated optimal photosynthetic rate and water stress. Regional evapotranspiration is calculated as a function of canopy conductance, equilibrium evapotranspiration rate, and soil moisture using a simple planetary boundary layer parameterization. This scheme results in a two-way coupling of the carbon and water fluxes through canopy conductance, allowing simulation of the response of photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and leaf area to environmental factors including atmospheric CO2. Comparison with the mapped distribution of global vegetation shows that the model successfully reproduces the broad-scale patterns in potential natural vegetation distribution. Comparison with NPP measurements, and with an FPAR (fractional absorbed photosynthetically active radiation) climatology based on remotely sensed greenness measurements, provides further checks on the model's internal logic. The model is envisaged as a tool for integrated analysis of the impacts of changes in climate and CO2 on ecosystem structure and function.},

Game theory provides a mathematical language for understanding evolution by natural selection. Continuous-trait game theory starts with the notion of an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) and adds the concept of convergence stability (that the ESS is an evolutionary attractor). With these basic tools in hand, continuous-trait game theory can be easily extended to model evolution under conditions of disruptive selection and speciation, nonequilibrium population dynamics, stochastic environments, coevolution, and more. Many models applying these tools to evolutionary ecology and coevolution have been developed in the past two decades. Going forward we emphasize the communication of the conceptual simplicity and underlying unity of ideas inherent in continuous-trait game theory and the development of new applications to biological questions.},

The ratio of concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in vegetation has been proposed as an index of the relative limitation of biomass production by N and P, but its utility has not been tested well in grasslands. At five sites in Kruger National Park, South Africa, across soil and precipitation contrasts, N and P were added in a factorial design to grass-dominated plots. Although the N:P ratio of unfertilized vegetation across all sites (5.8) would have indicated that production was N-limited, aboveground production was consistently co-limited by N and P. Aboveground production was still greater in plots fertilized with N and P than in those fertilized with just N, but the N:P ratio did not exceed standard thresholds for P limitation in N-fertilized vegetation. Comparisons among sites showed little pattern between site N:P ratio and relative responses to N and P. When combined with results from other grassland fertilization studies, these data suggest that the N:P ratio of grasses has little ability to predict limitation in upland grasslands. Co-limitation between N and P appears to be much more widespread than would be predicted from simple assumptions of vegetative N:P ratios.},

After 5 yr 14 species persisted; no rare species survived. The experimental communities differed from random expectation and were assembled by rules that constrained their organization. There were strong and consistent effects of fertility, water level, and leaf litter on community composition. Community assembly was modeled as a series of environmental filters. Some aspects of assembly were deterministic: trajectories were constrained within two ''pathway basins'' and species rank abundances were significantly concordant within treatments. Other factors indicated that assembly has a strong stochastic component: 50\% of species were present only occasionally and we cannot accurately predict species ranks. Community stochasticity did not show any clear patterns among treatments.},

Earlier studies often assumed a community with only one interaction type, either an antagonistic, competitive, or mutualistic interaction, leaving open the question of what the diversity of interaction types contributes to the community maintenance. We show theoretically that the multiple interaction types might hold the key to understanding community dynamics. A moderate mixture of antagonistic and mutualistic interactions can stabilize population dynamics. Furthermore, increasing complexity leads to increased stability in a ``hybrid'' community. We hypothesize that the diversity of species and interaction types may be the essential element of biodiversity that maintains ecological communities.},

@article{hoffmann_seasonal_2005,
	Abstract = {Interactions between trees and grasses that influence leaf area index (LAI) have important consequences for savanna ecosystem processes through their controls on water, carbon, and energy fluxes as well as fire regimes. We measured LAI, of the groundlayer (herbaceous and woody plants {\textless} 1-m tall) and shrub and tree layer (woody plants {\textgreater} 1-m tall), in the Brazilian cerrado over a range of tree densities from open shrub savanna to closed woodland through the annual cycle. During the dry season, soil water potential was strongly and positively correlated with grass LAI, and less strongly with tree and shrub LAI. By the end of the dry season, LAI of grasses, groundlayer dicots and trees declined to 28, 60, and 68\% of mean wet-season values, respectively. We compared the data to remotely sensed vegetation indices, finding that field measurements were more strongly correlated to the enhanced vegetation index (EVI, r(2) =0.71) than to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI, r(2) =0.49). Although the latter has been more widely used in quantifying leaf dynamics of tropical savannas, EVI appears better suited for this purpose. Our ground-based measurements demonstrate that groundlayer LAI declines with increasing tree density across sites, with savanna grasses being excluded at a tree LAI of approximately 3.3. LAI averaged 4.2 in nearby gallery (riparian) forest, so savanna grasses were absent, thereby greatly reducing fire risk and permitting survival of fire-sensitive forest tree species. Although edaphic conditions may partly explain the larger tree LAI of forests, relative to savanna, biological differences between savanna and forest tree species play an important role. Overall, forest tree species had 48\% greater LAI than congeneric savanna trees under similar growing conditions. Savanna and forest species play distinct roles in the structure and dynamics of savanna-forest boundaries, contributing to the differences in fire regimes, microclimate, and nutrient cycling between savanna and forest ecosystems.},

	Abstract = {Adaptive radiation is the rise of a diversity of ecological roles and role-specific adaptations within a lineage. Recently, some researchers have begun to use `adaptive radiation' or `radiation' as synonymous with `explosive species diversification'. This essay aims to clarify distinctions between these concepts, and the related ideas of geographic speciation, sexual selection, key innovations, key landscapes and ecological keys. Several examples are given to demonstrate that adaptive radiation and explosive diversification are not the same phenomenon, and that focusing on explosive diversification and the analysis of phylogenetic topology ignores much of the rich biology associated with adaptive radiation, and risks generating confusion about the nature of the evolutionary forces driving species diversification. Some `radiations' involve bursts of geographic speciation or sexual selection, rather than adaptive diversification; some adaptive radiations have little or no effect on speciation, or even a negative effect. Many classic examples of `adaptive radiation' appear to involve effects driven partly by geographic speciation, species' dispersal abilities, and the nature of extrinsic dispersal barriers; partly by sexual selection; and partly by adaptive radiation in the classical sense, including the origin of traits and invasion of adaptive zones that result in decreased diversification rates but add to overall diversity.},

Location: Acacia nigrescens/Combretum apiculatum savanna, Kruger National Park, South Africa (25 degrees S, 31 degrees E). Methods: Remotely-sensed data from the MODIS sensor were used to provide a five year record of greenness (NDVI) between 2000 and 2005. The seasonal and inter-annual patterns of leaf display of trees and grasses were described, using additional ecological information to separate the greening signal of each life form from the satellite time series. Linking this data to daily meteorological and soil moisture data allowed the cues responsible for leaf flush in trees and grasses to be identified and a predictive model of savanna leaf-out was developed. This was tested on a 22-year NDVI dataset from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer. A day length cue for tree green-up predicted 86\% of the green-ups with an accuracy better than one month. A soil moisture and day length cue for grass green-up predicted 73\% of the green-ups with an accuracy better than a month, and 82\% within 45 days. This accuracy could be improved if the temporal resolution of the satellite data was shortened from the current two weeks. Conclusions: The data show that at a landscape scale savanna trees have a less variable phenological cycle (within and between years) than grasses. Realistic biophysical models of savanna systems need to take this into account. Using climatic data to predict these dynamics is a feasible approach.},

	Abstract = {Savannas are very important tropical ecosystems characterized by co-dominance of herbaceous vegetation and less abundant trees and shrubs. Models of the dynamics of the spatial distribution of aboveground components of grass plants can be a useful tool to understand the dynamics of savanna ecosystems. We developed a model of grass plant growth as a collection of the individual dynamic behavior of shoots inspired in data for plants of three species of common grasses in the Venezuelan savannas. The species are: Elyonurus adustus (Trin.) E. Ekman., Leptocoryphium lanatum (Kunth) Nees and Andropogon semiberbis (Nees) Kunth. These species represent various types of architecture and regeneration response to fire. The individual-shoot model is based on shoot emergence. mortality, and elongation given by Richards' equation, plus a few simple geometric considerations. Model Output is shoot density in each cell of a square grid at several vertical levels. Differences in patterns of shoot density among species are explained by changing a set of parameter values related to growth form and phenology. Vertical distribution of shoot density was calculated from the Simulation results and the field data with the purpose of deriving a simpler lumped shoot-population model. This simpler demographic model is based oil a projection matrix that predicts the essential dynamics of growth in the vertical dimension. The transient and final behavior of vertical distribution of shoot density are calculated with the matrix model and compared to field data yielding good fit as assessed by the root mean square (RMS) error of difference between the field data and the model results. This error is of the same magnitude as the RMS difference among the three field data replicates. Sensitivity analysis of the matrix model for the three species was used to identify those vertical levels for which the damping ratio is more sensitive to a perturbation. For early and precocius species (E. adustus and L. lanatum), the top level is more sensitive whereas the late blooming species (A. semiberbis) is more sensitive at lower levels. Although developed for these three species, the matrix model is generic and therefore can be applied to plants with the basic growth form of perennial grasses of seasonal savanna ecosystems. Applications include scaling-up the individual-shoot model to larger areas and analysis of savanna dynamics subject to fire. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

resource requirement examining elytron length and change in larval weight. The results showed the new strain had lower resource

	Abstract = {The relationship between leaf area and diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) or sapwood area (AS) has been used to estimate stand leaf area or biomass of forest canopies. It has been suggested that intra-specific variations in the relationship between stand leaf area and d.b.h. or AS can introduce a systematic error in these estimates for younger and older stands unless additional parameters relating to canopy structure are included in allometric functions. We collected data from a Sitka spruce chronosequence to parametrize and test different algorithms for the estimation of foliar biomass (FB) and litter inputs over a range of forest ages. FB estimates were significantly improved when additional biometric information relating to crown structure (canopy openness and height of live crown) was included in the models. Although the use of the relationship between leaf area and AS for the estimation of leaf area is justified by theoretical considerations (pipe model theory), we show that d.b.h. and other canopy parameters provided the most robust estimation of leaf area across different-aged stands. Our results also suggest that the accuracy of litter input estimates depends on needle retention time and annual turnover rate, particularly immediately before and after canopy closure.},

	Abstract = {Plants growing at high elevations in tropical mountains show a scleromorphic habit at the leaf and plant level, despite the fact that alpine landscapes are generally considered to be cool and humid environments. This paper tests the hypotheses (1) that aridity (potential transpiration E-P/rainfall P) in tropical alpine environments can be high despite low temperatures, and (2) that aridity in tropical alpine environments may be correlated with scleromorphic habit. A leaf energy balance model was developed that calculates the change in E-P for a standard leaf along elevational transects in equatorial and middle-latitude mountains by accounting for pressure (elevation) and temperature effects on transpiration. Modeled leaf-level transpiration in tropical alpine environments can be substantial and may even exceed transpiration at low elevations in middle latitudes. At 5000 m elevation, a high diffusion coefficient for water vapor under low air pressure and a high radiation load result in E-P rates 50-90\% higher in tropical mountains than in middle-latitude ones. High E-P rates at high elevations are expected (1) in mountains of the dry tropics with low cloudiness and low rainfall but high radiation and, (2) in small oceanic mountain ranges with a strong advection of moist air and, thus, a reduced temperature lapse rate on the slope. Data from tropical Mount Haleakala (Maui, Hawaii) and from the middle-latitude Tyrolian Alps (Austria) were used to test the predicted E-P rates. The two mountains sharply contrast with respect to vertical distribution of E-P and rainfall. At high elevation on Maul, the calculated E-P was high (and was consistent with measured atmometer evaporation rates E-m), whereas rainfall was moderate to low. At high elevation in the Alps, both E-P and E-m were low compared to similar elevations on Maul, but rainfall was high. Worldwide mountain climate data sets show that rainfall tends to decrease upslope in many tropical mountains, while it increases with elevation in most middle-latitude mountains. I conclude that (1) high-elevation environments in tropical mountains are more arid than similar elevations in middle-latitude mountains as a result of both higher evaporative demand and lower rainfall, and (2) that aridity can significantly contribute to the scleromorphy of tropical alpine plants which had previously been attributed to low temperature or high radiation effects alone.},

	Abstract = {1. Asymmetric competition is an unequal division of resources amongst competing plants. Thus, competition may be asymmetric in the sense that some individuals remove a disproportionately large amount of resource. Alternatively, competition may be asymmetric in that one species removes a disproportionately large amount of resource. The mechanisms determining the two forms of asymmetry may be similar, for example through initial size advantage or over-topping. 2. We explore the consequences of these two forms of asymmetry for competition models that predict mean performance as a function of the density of interacting species. We do so using neighbourhood models that explicitly consider the allocation of resources to individuals within an interacting mixture. 3. Asymmetric individual competition is modelled by assuming that individuals are formed into a competitive hierarchy such that individuals at the top of the hierarchy are able to remove more resources than those at the bottom. Mean performance declines exponentially, moving from top to bottom of the hierarchy. Asymmetric species-level competition is modelled by assuming that one species occupies all of the upper positions in the competitive hierarchy and hence dominates the resource. 4. When competition is asymmetric at the species level, yield-density responses follow an exponential decline. Otherwise, arithmetic mean performance follows a classic hyperbolic response. 5. Using this approach, we explore the asymmetry of competition between wheat and three species of weeds.},

Current mathematical modeling approaches typically use either single-parameter or local sensitivity analyses. However, these methods do not accurately assess uncertainty and sensitivity in the system as, by default, they hold all other parameters fixed at baseline values. Using techniques described within we demonstrate how a multi-dimensional parameter space can be studied globally so all uncertainties can be identified. Further, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques can help to identify and ultimately control uncertainties. In this work we develop methods for applying existing analytical tools to perform analyses on a variety of mathematical and computer models. We compare two specific types of global sensitivity analysis indexes that have proven to be among the most robust and efficient. Through familiar and new examples of mathematical and computer models, we provide a complete methodology for performing these analyses, in both deterministic and stochastic settings, and propose novel techniques to handle problems encountered during these types of analyses.

@article{briske_vegetation_2003,
	Abstract = {1. Rangeland ecologists have been debating the validity of two current paradigms for the evaluation of vegetation dynamics on rangelands. This debate frequently contrasts the conventional model of continuous and reversible vegetation dynamics (range model) with a more contemporary model that can accommodate discontinuous and non-reversible vegetation change (state-and-transition model). 2. The range and the state-and-transition models are conceptually related to the equilibrium and non-equilibrium paradigms within ecology, respectively. The methodological dichotomy that has developed between the range and the state-and-transition models has fostered the perception that these two ecological paradigms are mutually exclusive. We challenge this perception and contend that both methodologies and their corresponding paradigms are non-exclusive. 3. Equilibrium and non-equilibrium ecosystems are not distinguished on the basis of unique processes or functions, but rather by the evaluation of system dynamics at various temporal and spatial scales. Consequently, ecosystems may express both equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics. This confirms early interpretations that ecosystems are distributed along a continuum from equilibrium to non-equilibrium states. 4. Although both equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics occur in numerous ecosystems, the empirical evidence is frequently confounded by (i) uncertainty regarding the appropriate evidence necessary to distinguish between paradigms; (ii) disproportionate responses among vegetation attributes to climate and grazing; (iii) comparisons among systems with varying degrees of managerial involvement; and (iv) the evaluation of vegetation dynamics at various spatial and temporal scales. 5. Synthesis and applications . This critique supports the conclusion that a paradigm shift has not taken place in rangeland ecology, but rather, the debate has forced a more comprehensive interpretation of vegetation dynamics along the entirety of the equilibrium-non-equilibrium continuum. Therefore, the rangeland debate should be redirected from the dichotomy between paradigms to one of paradigm integration.},

	Abstract = {All species' ranges are the result of successful past invasions. Thus, models of species' invasions and their failure can provide insight into the formation of a species' geographic range. Here, we study the properties of invasion models when a species cannot persist below a critical population density known as an "Allee threshold." In both spatially continuous reaction-diffusion models and spatially discrete coupled ordinary-differential-equation models, the Allee effect can cause an invasion to fail. In patchy landscapes (with dynamics described by the spatially discrete model), range limits caused by propagation failure (pinning) are stable over a wide range of parameters, whereas, in an uninterrupted habitat (with dynamics described by a spatially continuous model), the zero velocity solution is structurally unstable and thus unlikely to persist in nature. We derive conditions under which invasion waves are pinned in the discrete space model and discuss their implications for spatially complex dynamics, including critical phenomena, in ecological landscapes. Our results suggest caution when interpreting abrupt range limits as stemming either from competition between species or a hard environmental limit that cannot be crossed: under a wide range of plausible ecological conditions, species' ranges may be limited by an Allee effect. Several example systems appear to fit our general model.},

Summary

Model--data comparisons of plant physiological processes provide an understanding of mechanisms underlying vegetation responses to climate. We simulated the physiology of a pi{\~n}on pine--juniper woodland (Pinus edulis--Juniperus monosperma) that experienced mortality during a 5 yr precipitation-reduction experiment, allowing a framework with which to examine our knowledge of drought-induced tree mortality. We used six models designed for scales ranging from individual plants to a global level, all containing state-of-the-art representations of the internal hydraulic and carbohydrate dynamics of woody plants. Despite the large range of model structures, tuning, and parameterization employed, all simulations predicted hydraulic failure and carbon starvation processes co-occurring in dying trees of both species, with the time spent with severe hydraulic failure and carbon starvation, rather than absolute thresholds per se, being a better predictor of impending mortality. Model and empirical data suggest that limited carbon and water exchanges at stomatal, phloem, and below-ground interfaces were associated with mortality of both species. The model--data comparison suggests that the introduction of a mechanistic process into physiology-based models provides equal or improved predictive power over traditional process-model or empirical thresholds. Both biophysical and empirical modeling approaches are useful in understanding processes, particularly when the models fail, because they reveal mechanisms that are likely to underlie mortality. We suggest that for some ecosystems, integration of mechanistic pathogen models into current vegetation models, and evaluation against observations, could result in a breakthrough capability to simulate vegetation dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Drought reduces plant productivity, induces widespread plant mortality and limits the geographic distribution of plant species. As climates warm and precipitation patterns shift in the future, understanding the distribution of the diversity of plant drought tolerance is central to predicting future ecosystem function and resilience to climate change. These questions are especially pressing for the world's 11,000 grass species, which dominate a large fraction of the terrestrial biosphere, yet are poorly characterized with respect to responses to drought. Here, we show that physiological drought tolerance, which varied tenfold among 426 grass species, is well distributed both climatically and phylogenetically, suggesting most native grasslands are likely to contain a high diversity of drought tolerance. Consequently, local species may help maintain ecosystem functioning in response to changing drought regimes without requiring long-distance migrations of grass species. Furthermore, physiologically drought-tolerant species had higher rates of water and carbon dioxide exchange than intolerant species, indicating that severe droughts may generate legacies for ecosystem functioning. In all, our findings suggest that diverse grasslands throughout the globe have the potential to be resilient to drought in the face of climate change through the local expansion of drought-tolerant species.},

This definition forms the common theme for our review of approaches for demonstrating the importance of chaos in ecology. We emphasize that this definition of chaos can include the effects of noise, and that there is no dichotomy between stochasticity and chaos. We review three classes of approaches for studying chaos in ecology: models, analysis of time series, and experiments. Current ideas from modelling approaches demonstrate the plausibility of chaos. New approaches for analyzing time series are based on using the presence of a positive Lvapunov exponent to indicate sensitive dependence on initial conditions. The methods can deal with relatively short time series that include the effects of noise, with chaotic dynamics appearing in at least some cases. Experimental work is just beginning, spurred by modelling results and the new methods for analyzing times series. We suggest directions tor further work in each of these approaches.},

	Abstract = {Fire is the primary disturbance factor in many terrestrial ecosystems. Wildfire alters vegetation structure and composition, affects carbon storage and biogeochemical cycling, and results in the release of climatically relevant trace gases including CO2, CO, CH4, NOx, and aerosols. One way of assessing the impacts of global wildfire on centennial to multi-millennial timescales is to use process-based fire models linked to dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs). Here we present an update to the LPJ-DGVM and a new fire module based on SPITFIRE that includes several improvements to the way in which fire occurrence, behaviour, and the effects of fire on vegetation are simulated. The new LPJ-LMfire model includes explicit calculation of natural ignitions, the representation of multi-day burning and coalescence of fires, and the calculation of rates of spread in different vegetation types. We describe a new representation of anthropogenic biomass burning under preindustrial conditions that distinguishes the different relationships between humans and fire among hunter-gatherers, pastoralists, and farmers. We evaluate our model simulations against remote-sensing-based estimates of burned area at regional and global scale. While wildfire in much of the modern world is largely influenced by anthropogenic suppression and ignitions, in those parts of the world where natural fire is still the dominant process (e.g. in remote areas of the boreal forest and subarctic), our results demonstrate a significant improvement in simulated burned area over the original SPITFIRE. The new fire model we present here is particularly suited for the investigation of climate--human--fire relationships on multi-millennial timescales prior to the Industrial Revolution.},

@article{san_jose_fire_1997,
	Abstract = {Factors affecting the tree/grass coexistence in savannas and consequences on the organic matter budgets were explored in this review. In savannas, water and nutrients are commonly; limiting resources. and consequently the tree and grasses are interacting. However, this interaction is only apparent since the tree/grass competitors are coexisting in savanna vegetations, which are characterized by a wide range of physionogmic types spanning herbaceous to woodland savannas. The tree/grass coexistence is evident in climatic and edaphic savannas, whereas in humidic and mesic savannas, the fire factor controls tree density and its competitor ability depending upon the accumulation of organic matter. In order to explain the tree/grass coexistence several hypotheses have been proposed. An exclusion solution due to competitor superiority of grasses has been proposed for dry savannas. As the water supply increases, the grasses coexist by a spatial partitioning of the soil water resources. This equilibrium solution occurs by niche separation. Without ruling out these possibilities, there exist savannas where trees and grasses are competing by limiting resources. The competitive abilities of trees and grasses differed in response to environmental features; thus coexistence is associated with niche difference. In disturbance-prone savanna the mechanisms of the tree/grass coexistence for the competing species is based on a reduction in tree-grass competition due to control of tree density. Under savanna protection, grasses are competitively excluded by trees as the life-span of individuals is affected by the competitive interactions between trees and trees as well as trees and grasses. The causal mechanisms allowing tree/grass coexistance in savannas were explored on the basis of the ecological hypothesis of system equilibrium or stability. The changes it? the proportion of the tree/grass components affect the organic matter budget of the system. As a result of protection of the savannas, vegetation is able to sequester significant quantities of carbon. The calculated sequestering pool of carbon in both the restored forest vegetation and soil would be 5.99 Pg C for a restoration time of 51 years.},

	Abstract = {Leaf phenology was monitored for 49 woody species (trees and tall shrubs) each month over a 2.5-year period in a humid, wet-dry tropical eucalypt savanna at Solar Village, near Darwin, Australia. In the 10 most common species, which spanned the range of phenological types, phenology was monitored every two weeks. To investigate the relationships between leaf phenology and plant water status, pre-dawn leaf water potential was monitored in eight common species every 4-6 weeks, Four main phenological types were described: (1) evergreen species, which retained full canopy throughout the year; (2) brevi- or partly deciduous species, in which the amount of canopy fell significantly, but briefly, during at least one dry season during the study period, but to levels not below 50\% of full canopy; (3) semideciduous species in which canopy fell to below 50\% of full canopy in each of the dry seasons; and (4) fully deciduous species, which lost all leaves during the early-mid dry season, and remained leafless for at least one month. Of these 49 species, 24\% were evergreen, 20\% were brevideciduous, 29\% were semideciduous, and 27\% were fully deciduous. Leaf fall occurred 1-2 months earlier in the dry season for the fully deciduous species than for the semideciduous species. Leaf fall in all species was coincident with the attainment of seasonal minima in leaf water potential, which were, on average, about -1.5 to -2.0 MPa in the evergreen and semideciduous species, compared with about -0.5 to -1.0 MPa in the fully deciduous species. Leaf flushing occurred throughout the dry season in the two evergreen species, with a major peak in the late dry season. In five semideciduous species and one of the fully deciduous species, leaf flushing commenced in the late dry season prior to the occurrence of any rain. In two fully deciduous species, leaf flushing occurred only after the first storms of the early wet season. There was variation in the timing of flushing, both between species within years and between years for some species. However, all species commenced leaf flushing after water potentials rose, following the attainment of seasonal minima in pre-dawn leaf water potential. Soil moisture at 1 m did not fall below permanent wilting point during the dry season; hence, reserves of soil water at the end of the dry season were sufficient to support the whole-plant rehydration that preceded leaf flushing in the absence of rain. These results are consistent with hypotheses, developed in the neotropics, that leaf phenology in trees from the wet-dry tropics is largely controlled by endogenous mechanisms.},

However, the global extent of fire-driven discontinuities in tree cover is unknown, especially accounting for seasonality and soils.

Climate influences tree cover globally but, at intermediate rainfall (1000 to 2500 millimeters) with mild seasonality (less than 7 months), tree cover is bimodal, and only fire differentiates between savanna and forest. These may be alternative states over large areas, including parts of Amazonia and the Congo.

The main source of global climate change is human-induced changes in atmospheric composition. These perturbations primarily result from emissions associated with energy use, but on local and regional scales, urbanization and land use changes are also important. Although there has been progress in monitoring and understanding climate change, there remain many scientific, technical, and institutional impediments to precisely planning for, adapting to, and mitigating the effects of climate change. There is still considerable uncertainty about the rates of change that can be expected, but it is clear that these changes will be increasingly manifested in important and tangible ways, such as changes in extremes of temperature and precipitation, decreases in seasonal and perennial snow and ice extent, and sea level rise. Anthropogenic climate change is now likely to continue for many centuries. We are venturing into the unknown with climate, and its associated impacts could be quite disruptive.},

	Abstract = {To maximize net gain of a tree, leaves must be replaced when net gain of a leaf per unit time over the leaf's life span is maximum. A model in which leaf longevity is determined to maximize the net gain of a leaf per unit time is constructed. The model predicts that leaf longevity is short when initial net photosynthetic rate of the leaf is large, long when the construction cost of the leaf is large, and short when the decrease in net photosynthetic rate with time is large. The model describes leaf habit (deciduousness and evergreenness) with the length of the favorable period for photosynthesis within a year and simulates distributional pattern of leaf habit along latitudes. The percentages of evergreenness decrease with decreasing favorable-period length and reach the minimum at an intermediate length of the favorable period but increase again with a decrease in the length of the favorable period. A bimodal distributional pattern with two peaks, one at lower and the other at higher latitudes, is observed for the percentages of evergreenness. Percentages of deciduousness show a unimodal distribution pattern with a peak at midlatitude.},

This analysis was carried out for the savanna and tropical forest biomes, which are the predominant biomes in tropical South America. In both scenarios, the results indicate reduction of tropical forest cover areas which would be replaced by savannas. This reduction of tropical forests increases with the time through the end of the 21st century, mostly over southeastern Amazonia. Considering the biome changes from current potential vegetation in the case when at least 75\% of the calculations agree on the projected biome change (consensus), the decrease of the tropical forest area in South America is 3\% for the period 2020--2029, 9\% for 2050--2059 and 18\% for 2090--2099 for the A2 emission scenario.},

@article{liu_simulating_2007,
	Abstract = {We present the first synchronously coupled transient simulation of the evolution of the northern Africa climate-ecosystem for the last 6500 years in a global general circulation ocean-atmosphere-terrestrial ecosystem model. The model simulated the major abrupt vegetation collapse in the southern Sahara at about 5 ka, consistent with the proxy records. Local precipitation, however, shows a much more gradual decline with time, implying a lack of strong positive vegetation feedback on annual rainfall during the collapse. The vegetation change in northern Africa is driven by local precipitation decline and strong precipitation variability. In contrast, the change of precipitation is dominated by internal climate variability and a gradual monsoonal climate response to orbital forcing. In addition, some minor vegetation changes are also simulated in different regions across northern Africa The model also simulated a gradual annual mean surface cooling in the subtropical North Atlantic towards the latest Holocene, as well as a reduced seasonal cycle of SST. The SST response is caused largely by the insolation forcing, while the annual mean cooling is also reinforced by the increased coastal upwelling near the east boundary. The increased upwelling results from a southward retreat of the North Africa monsoon system, and, in turn, an increased northeasterly trade wind. The simulated changes of SST and upwelling are also largely consistent with marine proxy records, albeit with a weaker magnitude in the model. The mismatch between the collapse of vegetation and gradual transition of rainfall suggests that the vegetation collapse is not caused by a strong positive vegetation feedback. Instead, it is suggested that the Mid-Holocene collapse of North African vegetation is caused mainly by a nonlinear response of the vegetation to a precipitation threshold in the presence of strong climate variability. The implication to the modeling and observations is also discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{williams_contrasting_2005,
	Abstract = {[1] While it is generally believed that the magnitude and composition of vegetation cover influence land-atmosphere water and carbon fluxes, observations indicate that in some cases, fluxes are insensitive to land cover contrasts. This seeming inconsistency may be resolved by contrasting fluxes over short and long timescales. To explore this potential contrast, we developed and tested a model designed to simulate daily to decadal land surface water and carbon fluxes and vegetation dynamics for water-limited ecosystems. The model reproduces (R-2 {\textgreater} 0.76) observed daily fluxes under increasing water limitation and captures representative dynamics of leaf area and fractional cover of dominant grass and wood vegetation. We parameterized the model for southern African savannas and conducted two sets of numerical experiments with either having fixed ( static) grass and wood covers or allowing them to adjust dynamically with production. Static simulations reveal that the direct effect of rainfall on soil moisture is more important than the prevailing grass and wood cover states in controlling annual transpiration and production. Dynamic simulations indicate sensitivity of daily fluxes to vegetation cover states during high soil water periods. However, depletion of finite soil water prevents an integrated effect from lasting over interstorm to annual timescales. Correspondingly, while seasonal vegetation dynamics enhance seasonality in fluxes, vegetation dynamics have only minor influence on annual transpiration and production. In fact, annual rainfall explains most (R {\textgreater} 0.85) of the temporal variation in annual water and carbon fluxes. Hence, despite alteration of daily and seasonal distributions of fluxes, for water-limited ecosystems, vegetation dynamics have little effect on annual transpiration and production.},

@article{domingues_parameterization_2005,
	Abstract = {Carbon flux of Amazonian primary forest vegetation has been shown to vary both spatially and temporally. Process-based models are adequate tools to understand the basis of such variation and can also provide projections to future scenarios. The parameterization of such process-based models requires information from the vegetation in question simply because ecosystem-level gas exchange is a direct result of the tightly coupled interaction between local vegetation and regional climate. In this study, data are presented concerning canopy structure [ leaf area index (LAI), and the ratio of leaf dry mass to leaf area (LMA)], leaf chemistry [area-based foliar nitrogen content (N(area)) and carbon isotope composition (delta(13)C)], and photosynthetic gas exchange [ maximum carbon assimilation rates (A(max)), stomatal conductance (g(s)@A(max)), maximum carboxylation capacity (V(cmax)), and respiration rates (R(d))] versus relative height from an extensive survey of primary forest vegetation of the Santarem region ( eastern Amazon, Santarem, Federal State of Para, Brazil). Ground-level LAI values ranged between 4.5 and 5.9. Both A(max) and V(cmax) showed large variations within the canopy profile with values ranging between 2.4 and 15.7 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and between 10.1 and 105.7 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively. Also, N(area) varied between 0.75 to 4.19 gN m(-2), and similar to A(max) and V(cmax), showed higher values at the top of the canopy. Variations were detected among sites in patterns of vertical distribution of N(area) and LAI, indicating spatial heterogeneity of the forest. Also, no statistically significant evidence of seasonal variations on parameters was observed, indicating that there is limited gas exchange acclimation by the vegetation to wet or dry seasons.},

	Abstract = {We model future changes in land biogeochemistry and biogeography across East Africa. East Africa is one of few tropical regions where general circulation model (GCM) future climate projections exhibit a robust response of strong future warming and general annual-mean rainfall increases. Eighteen future climate projections from nine GCMs participating in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment were used as input to the LPJ dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM), which predicted vegetation patterns and carbon storage in agreement with satellite observations and forest inventory data under the present-day climate. All simulations showed future increases in tropical woody vegetation over the region at the expense of grasslands. Regional increases in net primary productivity (NPP) (18-36\%) and total carbon storage (3-13\%) by 2080-2099 compared with the present-day were common to all simulations. Despite decreases in soil carbon after 2050, seven out of nine simulations continued to show an annual net land carbon sink in the final decades of the 21st century because vegetation biomass continued to increase. The seasonal cycles of rainfall and soil moisture show future increases in wet season rainfall across the GCMs with generally little change in dry season rainfall. Based on the simulated present-day climate and its future trends, the GCMs can be grouped into four broad categories. Overall, our model results suggest that East Africa, a populous and economically poor region, is likely to experience some ecosystem service benefits through increased precipitation, river runoff and fresh water availability. Resulting enhancements in NPP may lead to improved crop yields in some areas. Our results stand in partial contradiction to other studies that suggest possible negative consequences for agriculture, biodiversity and other ecosystem services caused by temperature increases.},

	Abstract = {Land-use change, mainly forest burning, harvest, or clearing for agriculture, may compose 15 to 40 percent of annual human-caused emissions of carbon (C) to the atmosphere. Spatially extensive data on forest C pools can validate and parameterize atmospheric and ecosystem models of those fluxes and quantify fluxes from forest change. Excellent evidence exists that light detection and ranging (lidar) waveforms can be scaled to estimate forest biomass and aboveground C pools. The Geoscience Laser Altimeter Systmem (GLAS) instrument provides satellite-based continuous return lidar data and may provide a way to inventory forest C pools globally. It was launched aboard the Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) on January 12, 2003. Here we explore whether GLAS data may support global inventory of forest C pools using the Amazon river basin as a study area. Forest C budgets in Amazonia are globally significant. However, globally-derived and validated Amazonian forest biomass-waveform relationships are not yet available. Consequently, here we address only vegetation canopy height. Over the Amazon basin, lands with at least 75 percent tree cover had GLAS-measured canopy heights averaging 30.48 $\pm$ 0.35 m (N = 2127). Fifty percent of measurements ranged from 25-35 m, agreeing with ground-based measurements in tierra firme forest. Lands with at least 60 percent tree cover had average canopy heights of 29.69 $\pm$ 0.10 m (N=2734). Regression-based mapping models relating waveform widths to data from maps of tree cover and elevation, or those variables plus generalized soil type, explain 36 to 47 percent of observed variation in mean vegetation canopy heights where tree cover is at least 20 percent. Finally, secondary forest age, as mapped with time series data over an area spanning three adjacent Landsat scenes in Rondonia, Brazil, was significantly related to GLAS-derived height. These results provide evidence that GLAS waveforms can contribute to global inventories of forest C pools.},

The species studied included two light-demanding pioneers (Miconia argentea and Apeiba membranacea) and three shade-tolerant young- or old-forest species (Pouteria reticulata, Gustavia superba, and Trichilia tuberculata). Growth analysis revealed that shoot and root dry weights and hydraulic conductances and leaf area all increased exponentially with time. Alternative methods of scaling measured parameters to reveal differences that might explain adaptations to microsites are discussed. Scaling root conductance to root surface area or root length revealed a few species differences but nothing that correlated with adaptation to light regimes. Scaling of root surface area or root length to root dry weight revealed that pioneers produced significantly more root area and length per gram dry weight investment than shade-tolerant species. Scaling of root and shoot hydraulic conductances to leaf area and scaling of root conductance to root dry weight and shoot conductance to shoot dry weight also revealed that pioneers were significantly more conductive to water than shade-tolerant species. The advantages of scaling hydraulic parameters to leaf surface area are discussed in terms of the Ohm's law analogue of water flow in plants.},

Thus, changes in the carbon stock and the proportion in the tree/grass proportion were evaluated throughout age states. Results indicate that the carbon stock in the vegetation increased from 207 to 9215 g C m(-2) whereas in the soil, it varied 6680 to 12196 g C m(-2) The carbon stock accumulation was mainly related to increases in the woody layer from 36 to 9215 g C m(-2) (255-fold) and in the soil from 1341 to 12196 g C m(-2) (nine-fold), respectively. The estimated pool of carbon sequestered in the Orinoco Llanos by the restored forest in 51 years was 5.69 Pg C.

	Abstract = {Elephant are increasing across some areas of Africa leading to concerns that they may reduce woodlands through their feeding. Droughts may help limit elephant numbers, but they are generally both episodic and local. To explore more general impacts of rainfall, we examine how its annual variation influences elephant survival across ten sites. These sites span an almost coast-to-coast transect of southern Africa that holds the majority of the similar to 500,000 remaining savanna elephants. Elephants born in high rainfall years survive better than elephants born in low rainfall years. The relationship is generally weak, except at the two fenced sites, where rainfall greatly influenced juvenile survival. In these two sites, there are also extensive networks of artificial water. Rainfall likely affects elephant survival through its influence on food. The provision of artificial water opens new areas for elephants in the dry season, while fencing restricts their movements in the wet season. We conclude that the combination of these factors makes elephant survival more susceptible to reductions in rainfall. As a result, elephants living in enclosed reserves may be the first populations to feel the impacts of global warming which will decrease average rainfall and increase the frequency of droughts. A way to prevent these elephants from damaging the vegetation within these enclosed parks is for managers to reduce artificial water sources or, whenever practical, to remove fences.},

We investigate a model that predicts the outcome of competition for nutrients and light in a mixed water column on the basis of monoculture characteristics. Growth in monoculture leads to a steady state. The nutrient availability and light penetration in this steady state characterize the minimal resource requirements of a species. These minimal requirements not only determine monoculture growth but also the outcome of competition. We show that competition for nutrients and light can be investigated by means of a graphical isocline approach. In contrast to earlier resource-based approaches, our model predicts that it is not only the ratio of nutrient supply to light supply that matters for the outcome of competition but also their absolute supply rates. It is even possible that a species that competes successfully when there is a high or low light supply is displaced when the light supply is intermediate. Factors such as mixing depth and background turbidity also affect the composition of phytoplankton communities. Still. our model predicts that at most two species can stably coexist in a mixed water column. Hence, the spatial heterogeneity imposed by a light gradient is nor sufficient to solve Hutchinson's paradox of the plankton.},

	Abstract = {The conceptual framework used by ecologists and biogeochemists must allow for accurate and clearly defined comparisons of carbon fluxes made with disparate techniques across a spectrum of temporal and spatial scales. Consistent with usage over the past four decades, we define "net ecosystem production" (NEP) as the net carbon accumulation by ecosystems. Past use of this term has been ambiguous, because it has been used conceptually as a measure of carbon accumulation by ecosystems, but it has often been calculated considering only the balance between gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration. This calculation ignores other carbon fluxes from ecosystems (e.g leaching of dissolved carbon and losses associated with disturbance). To avoid conceptual ambiguities, we argue that NEP be defined, as in the past, as the net carbon accumulation by ecosystems and that it explicitly incorporate all the carbon fluxes from an ecosystem, including autotrophic respiration, heterotrophic respiration, losses associated with disturbance, dissolved and particulate carbon losses, volatile organic compound emissions. and lateral transfers among ecosystems. Net biome productivity (NBP), which has been proposed to account for carbon loss during episodic disturbance, is equivalent to NEP at regional or global scales. The multi-scale conceptual framework we describe provides continuity between flux measurements made at the scale of soil profiles and chambers, forest inventories, eddy covariance towers, aircraft, and inversions of remote atmospheric flask samples, allowing a direct comparison of NEP estimates made at all temporal and spatial scales.},

@article{salinger_climate_2005,
	Abstract = {Prior to the 20th century Northern Hemisphere average surface air temperatures have varied in the order of 0.5 degrees C back to AD 1000. Various climate reconstructions indicate that slow cooling took place until the beginning of the 20th century. Subsequently, global-average surface air temperature increased by about 0.6 degrees C with the 1990s being the warmest decade on record. The pattern of warming has been greatest over mid-latitude northern continents in the latter part of the century. At the same time the frequency of air frosts has decreased over many land areas, and there has been a drying in the tropics and sub-tropics. The late 20th century changes have been attributed to global warming because of increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations due to human activities. Underneath these trends is that of decadal scale variability in the Pacific basin at least induced by the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), which causes decadal changes in climate averages. On interannnual timescales El Ni (n) over tildeo/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) causes much variability throughout many tropical and subtropical regions and some mid-latitude areas. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) provides climate perturbations over Europe and northern Africa. During the course of the 21st century global-average surface temperatures are very likely to increase by 2 to 4.5 degrees C as greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere increase. At the same time there will be changes in precipitation, and climate extremes such as hot days, heavy rainfall and drought are expected to increase in many areas. The combination of global warming, superimposed on decadal climate variability (IPO) and interannual fluctuations (ENSO, NAO) are expected lead to a century of increasing climate variability and change that will be unprecedented in the history of human settlement. Although the changes of the past and present have stressed food and fibre production at times, the 21st century changes will be extremely challenging to agriculture and forestry.},

	Abstract = {Earth system models demonstrate large uncertainty in projected changes in terrestrial carbon budgets. The lack of inclusion of adaptive responses of vegetation communities to the environment has been suggested to hamper the ability of modeled vegetation to adequately respond to environmental change. In this study, variation in functional responses of vegetation has been added to an Earth System Model (ESM) based on ecological principles. The restriction of viable mean trait values of vegetation communities by the environment, called `habitat filtering', is an important ecological assembly rule and allows for determination of global scale trait-environment relationships. These relationships were applied to model trait variation for different plant functional types (PFTs). For three leaf traits (specific leaf area, maximum carboxylation rate at 25 $\,^{\circ}$C, and maximum electron transport rate at 25 $\,^{\circ}$C) relationships with multiple environmental drivers, like precipitation, temperature, radiation and CO2, were determined for the PFTs within the Max Planck Institute ESM. With these relationships, spatiotemporal variation in these formerly fixed traits in PFTs was modeled in global change projections (IPCC RCP8.5 scenario). Inclusion of this environment-driven trait variation resulted in a strong reduction of the global carbon sink by at least 33\% (2.1 Pg C yr−1) from the 2nd quarter of the 21st century onward compared to the default model with fixed traits. In addition, the mid and high latitudes became a stronger carbon sink and the tropics a stronger carbon source, caused by trait-induced differences in productivity and relative respirational costs. These results point towards a reduction of the global carbon sink when including a more realistic representation of functional vegetation responses, implying more carbon will stay airborne, which could fuel further climate change.

@article{bond-lamberty_fire_2007,
	Abstract = {Changes in climate, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and fire regimes have been occurring for decades in the global boreal forest(1-3), with future climate change likely to increase fire frequency(4)-the primary disturbance agent in most boreal forests(3,5). Previous attempts to assess quantitatively the effect of changing environmental conditions on the net boreal forest carbon balance have not taken into account the competition between different vegetation types on a large scale(6-9). Here we use a process model with three competing vascular and non-vascular vegetation types to examine the effects of climate, carbon dioxide concentrations and fire disturbance on net biome production, net primary production and vegetation dominance in 100 Mha of Canadian boreal forest. We find that the carbon balance of this region was driven by changes in fire disturbance from 1948 to 2005. Climate changes affected the variability, but not the mean, of the landscape carbon balance, with precipitation exerting a more significant effect than temperature. We show that more frequent and larger fires in the late twentieth century resulted in deciduous trees and mosses increasing production at the expense of coniferous trees. Our model did not however exhibit the increases in total forest net primary production that have been inferred from satellite data(1,10). We find that poor soil drainage decreased the variability of the landscape carbon balance, which suggests that increased climate and hydrological changes have the potential to affect disproportionately the carbon dynamics of these areas. Overall, we conclude that direct ecophysiological changes resulting from global climate change have not yet been felt in this large boreal region. Variations in the landscape carbon balance and vegetation dominance have so far been driven largely by increases in fire frequency.},

@article{baldocchi_how_2004,
	Abstract = {Savannas and open grasslands often co-exist in semi-arid regions. Questions that remain unanswered and are of interest to biometeorologists include: how do these contrasting landscapes affect the exchanges of energy on seasonal and annual time scales; and, do biophysical constraints imposed by water supply and water demand affect whether the land is occupied by open grasslands or savanna? To address these questions, and others, we examine how a number of abiotic, biotic and edaphic factors modulate water and energy flux densities over an oak-grass savanna and an annual grassland that coexist in the same climate but on soils with different hydraulic properties. The net radiation balance was greater over the oak woodland than the grassland, despite the fact that both canopies received similar sums of incoming short and long wave radiation. The lower albedo and lower radiative surface temperature of the transpiring woodland caused it to intercept and retain more long and shortwave energy over the course of the year, and particularly during the summer dry period. The partitioning of available energy into sensible and latent heat exchanged over the two canopies differed markedly. The annual sum of sensible heat exchange over the woodland was 40\% greater than that over the grassland (2.05 GJ m(-2) per year versus 1.46 GJ m(-2) per year). With regards to evaporation, the oak woodland evaporated about 380 mm of water per year and the grassland evaporated about 300 mm per year. Differences in available energy, canopy roughness, the timing of physiological functioning, water holding capacity of the soil and rooting depth of the vegetation explained the observed differences in sensible and latent heat exchange of the contrasting vegetation surfaces. The response of canopy evaporation to diminishing soil moisture was quantified by comparing normalized evaporation rates (in terms of equilibrium evaporation) with soil water potential and volumetric water content measurements. When soil moisture was ample normalized values of latent heat flux density were greater for the grassland (1.1-1.2) than for the oak savanna (0.7-0.8) and independent of moisture content. Normalized rates of evaporation over the grassland declined as volumetric water content dropped below 0.15 m(3) m(-3), which corresponded with a soil water potential of -1.5 MPa. The grassland senesced and quit transpiring when the volumetric water content of the soil dropped below -2.0 MPa. The oak trees, on the other hand, were able to transpire, albeit at low rates, under very dry soil conditions (soil water potentials below -4.0 MPa). The trees were able to endure such low water potentials and maintain basal levels of metabolism because ecological forcings kept the tree density and leaf area index of the woodland low, physiological factors forced the stomata to close progressively and the trees were able to tap deeper water sources (below 0.6 in) than the grasses.

	Abstract = {Scarcity of resources may result in high levels of animal aggregation; interference competition can occur in such a scenario and play a role in resource acquisition. Here, we test the hypothesis that animals could minimize interference competition by shifting their temporal niches in relation to competitors. In Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, we monitored waterholes in order to study agonistic interactions between elephants and other herbivore species. We also used a long-term data set from a yearly survey of waterhole attendance by herbivores to evaluate the influence of the presence of elephants on the use of waterholes by other herbivore species. Our results show that in drier years, waterholes are crowded with elephants early in the afternoon. In general, the species most affected by interference competition with elephants shift their temporal niches at the waterholes, thus maintaining a constant temporal overlaps with elephants. The species less affected by interference competition with elephants show no temporal niche shifts and increase their temporal overlap with elephants at waterholes, as predicted from a noncompetition hypothesis. This study provides evidence that interference competition with a behaviorally dominant large species influences the temporal niches of smaller species, and suggests that the potential costs associated with interference between elephants and other herbivores at waterholes are linked to shifts in diurnal activities rather than interactions and water acquisition itself.},

	Abstract = {Climate change has already triggered species distribution shifts in many parts of the world. Increasing impacts are expected for the future, yet few studies have aimed for a general understanding of the regional basis for species vulnerability. We projected late 21st century distributions for 1,350 European plants species under seven climate change scenarios. Application of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources Red List criteria to our projections shows that many European plant species could become severely threatened. More than half of the species we studied could be vulnerable or threatened by 2080. Expected species loss and turnover per pixel proved to be highly variable across scenarios (27-42\% and 45-63\% respectively, averaged over Europe) and across regions (2.5-86\% and 17-86\%, averaged over scenarios). Modeled species loss and turnover were found to depend strongly on the degree of change in just two climate variables describing temperature and moisture conditions. Despite the coarse scale of the analysis, species from mountains could be seen to be disproportionably sensitive to climate change (approximate to 60\% species loss). The boreal region was projected to lose few species, although gaining many others from immigration. The greatest changes are expected in the transition between the Mediterranean and Euro-Siberian regions. We found that risks of extinction for European plants may be large, even in moderate scenarios of climate change and despite inter-model variability.},

This mixed grass-tree biome rapidly appeared on the ecological stage 8 million years ago with the near-synchronous expansion of C-4 grasses around the world. We propose a new hypothesis for this global event based on a systems analysis that integrates recent advances in how fire influences cloud microphysics, climate and savanna ecology in a low carbon dioxide (CO2) world. We show that fire accelerates forest loss and C-4 grassland expansion through multiple positive feedback loops that each promote drought and more fire. A low CO2 atmosphere amplifies this cycle by limiting tree recruitment, allowing the ingress of C-4 grasses to greatly increase ecosystem flammability. Continued intensification of land use could enhance or moderate the network of feedbacks that have initiated, promoted and sustained savannas for millions of years. We suggest these alterations will overprint the effects of anthropogenic atmospheric change in coming decades.},

@article{betts_role_2004,
	Abstract = {A suite of simulations with the HadCM3LC coupled climate-carbon cycle model is used to examine the various forcings and feedbacks involved in the simulated precipitation decrease and forest dieback. Rising atmospheric CO2 is found to contribute 20\% to the precipitation reduction through the physiological forcing of stomatal closure, with 80\% of the reduction being seen when stomatal closure was excluded and only radiative forcing by CO2 was included. The forest dieback exerts two positive feedbacks on the precipitation reduction; a biogeophysical feedback through reduced forest cover suppressing local evaporative water recycling, and a biogeochemical feedback through the release of CO2 contributing to an accelerated global warming. The precipitation reduction is enhanced by 20\% by the biogeophysical feedback, and 5\% by the carbon cycle feedback from the forest dieback. This analysis helps to explain why the Amazonian precipitation reduction simulated by HadCM3LC is more extreme than that simulated in other GCMs; in the fully-coupled, climate-carbon cycle simulation, approximately half of the precipitation reduction in Amazonia is attributable to a combination of physiological forcing and biogeophysical and global carbon cycle feedbacks, which are generally not included in other GCM simulations of future climate change. The analysis also demonstrates the potential contribution of regional-scale climate and ecosystem change to uncertainties in global CO2 and climate change projections. Moreover, the importance of feedbacks suggests that a human-induced increase in forest vulnerability to climate change may have implications for regional and global scale climate sensitivity.},

@article{claussen_climate_2003,
	Abstract = {By using a climate system model of intermediate complexity, we have simulated long-term natural climate changes occurring over the last 9000 years. The paleo-simulations in which the model is driven by orbital forcing only, i.e., by changes in insolation caused by changes in the Earth's orbit, are compared with sensitivity simulations in which various scenarios of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration are prescribed. Focussing on climate and vegetation change in northern Africa, we recapture the strong greening of the Sahara in the early and mid-Holocene (some 9000-6000 years ago), and we show that some expansion of grassland into the Sahara is theoretically possible, if the atmospheric CO2 concentration increases well above pre-industrial values and if vegetation growth is not disturbed. Depending on the rate of CO2 increase, vegetation migration into the Sahara can be rapid, up to 1/10th of the Saharan area per decade, but Could not exceed a coverage of 45\%. In our model, vegetation expansion into today's Sahara is triggered by an increase in summer precipitation which is amplified by a positive feedback between vegetation and precipitation. This is valid for simulations with orbital forcing and greenhouse-gas forcing. However, we argue that the mid-Holocene climate optimum some 9000 to 6000 years ago with its marked reduction of deserts in northern Africa is not a direct analogue for future greenhouse-gas induced climate change, as previously hypothesized. Not only does the global pattern of climate change differ between the mid-Holocene model experiments and the greenhouse-gas sensitivity experiments, but the relative role of mechanisms which lead to a reduction of the Sahara also changes. Moreover, the amplitude of simulated vegetation cover changes in northern Africa is less than is estimated for mid-Holocene climate.},

Uncertainty in future terrestrial carbon storage due to differences in the climate projections is large. Changes by the end of the century range from -106 to +201 PgC, thus, even the sign of the response whether source or sink, is uncertain. Three out of five climate projections produce a land carbon source by the year 2100, one is approximately neutral and one a sink. A regional breakdown shows some robust qualitative features. Large areas of the boreal forest are shown as a future CO2 source, while a sink appears in the arctic. The sign of the response in tropical and sub-tropical ecosystems differs among models, due to the large variations in simulated precipitation patterns. The largest uncertainty is in the response of tropical rainforests of South America and Central Africa.},

	Abstract = {The phenological state of vegetation significantly affects exchanges of heat, mass, and momentum between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere. Although current patterns can be estimated from satellites, we lack the ability to predict future trends in response to climate change. We searched the literature for a common set of variables that might be combined into an index to quantify the greenness of vegetation throughout the year. We selected as variables: daylength (photoperiod), evaporative demand (vapor pressure deficit), and suboptimal (minimum) temperatures. For each variable we set threshold limits, within which the relative phenological performance of the vegetation was assumed to vary from inactive (0) to unconstrained (1). A combined Growing Season Index (GSI) was derived as the product of the three indices. Ten-day mean GSI values for nine widely dispersed ecosystems showed good agreement (r {\textgreater} 0.8) with the satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We also tested the model at a temperate deciduous forest by comparing model estimates with average field observations of leaf flush and leaf coloration. The mean absolute error of predictions at this site was 3 days for average leaf flush dates and 2 days for leaf coloration dates. Finally, we used this model to produce a global map that distinguishes major differences in regional phenological controls. The model appears sufficiently robust to reconstruct historical variation as well as to forecast future phenological responses to changing climatic conditions.},

The largest responses to model outcomes occur from year 100 onwards and indicate that climate change (1) stimulates the production of early-successional forests more than the production of late-successional forests and (2) accelerates the replacement of early-successional species by late-successional species. Linking of detailed process-based models with forest gap models enables interpretation of climate change effects beyond a change in tree growth only, and is an important tool for investigating effects of climate change on the development of mixed forests.

	Abstract = {Sustainable development of ecosystems through external ecosystem management is assuming importance for the environmentalists. To that effect, previous work by the authors looked at the option of manipulating population dynamics of the species in an ecosystem to achieve sustainability. Fisher information is used as-the quantifying measure of sustainability and optimal control theory is used to derive the control profiles. However, that work considered only deterministic systems. Uncertainty being prevalent in all systems, particularly in natural systems, this paper extends that work to analyse uncertain systems. Predator-prey models are used to model the species populations and different control philosophies are compared. Ito mean reverting process is used to model the stochastic process, and stochastic maximum principle is used to derive the control profiles. The results for the objective of FI variance minimization qualitatively agree with those for the deterministic system, while the results for the FI maximization objective differ. It is observed that the instability associated with the FI maximization objective for deterministic systems is absorbed by the noise introduced by the uncertainty. Quantitatively, it is observed that the degree of uncertainty, along with its presence, is also important to identify the most appropriate management strategy. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {The Lund--Potsdam--Jena Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (LPJ) combines process-based, large-scale representations of terrestrial vegetation dynamics and land-atmosphere carbon and water exchanges in a modular framework. Features include feedback through canopy conductance between photosynthesis and transpiration and interactive coupling between these `fast' processes and other ecosystem processes including resource competition, tissue turnover, population dynamics, soil organic matter and litter dynamics and fire disturbance. Ten plants functional types (PFTs) are differentiated by physiological, morphological, phenological, bioclimatic and fire-response attributes. Resource competition and differential responses to fire between PFTs influence their relative fractional cover from year to year. Photosynthesis, evapotranspiration and soil water dynamics are modelled on a daily time step, while vegetation structure and PFT population densities are updated annually.Simulations have been made over the industrial period both for specific sites where field measurements were available for model evaluation, and globally on a 0.5$\,^{\circ}$$\,^{\circ}$ × 0.5$\,^{\circ}$$\,^{\circ}$ grid. Modelled vegetation patterns are consistent with observations, including remotely sensed vegetation structure and phenology. Seasonal cycles of net ecosystem exchange and soil moisture compare well with local measurements. Global carbon exchange fields used as input to an atmospheric tracer transport model (TM2) provided a good fit to observed seasonal cycles of CO2 concentration at all latitudes. Simulated inter-annual variability of the global terrestrial carbon balance is in phase with and comparable in amplitude to observed variability in the growth rate of atmospheric CO2. Global terrestrial carbon and water cycle parameters (pool sizes and fluxes) lie within their accepted ranges. The model is being used to study past, present and future terrestrial ecosystem dynamics, biochemical and biophysical interactions between ecosystems and the atmosphere, and as a component of coupled Earth system models.},

@article{schroter_trophic_2004,
	Abstract = {The rate and scale of human-driven changes can exert profound impacts on ecosystems, the species that make them up and the services they provide that sustain humanity. Given the speed at which these changes are occurring, one of society's major challenges is to coexist within ecosystems and to manage ecosystem services in a sustainable way. The effect of possible scenarios of global change on ecosystem services can be explored using ecosystem models. Such models should adequately represent ecosystem processes above and below the soil surface (aboveground and belowground) and the interactions between them. We explore possibilities to include such interactions into ecosystem models at scales that range from global to local. At the regional to global scale we suggest to expand the plant functional type concept (aggregating plants into groups according to their physiological attributes) to include functional types of aboveground-belowground interactions. At the scale of discrete plant communities, process-based and organism-oriented models could be combined into "hybrid approaches" that include organism-oriented mechanistic representation of a limited number of trophic interactions in an otherwise process - oriented approach. Under global change the density and activity of organisms determining the processes may change non-linearly and therefore explicit knowledge of the organisms and their responses should ideally be included. At the individual plant scale a common organism-based conceptual model of aboveground-belowground interactions has emerged. This conceptual model facilitates the formulation of research questions to guide experiments aiming to identify patterns that are common within, but differ between, ecosystem types and biomes. Such experiments inform modelling approaches at larger scales. Future ecosystem models should better include this evolving knowledge of common patterns of aboveground-belowground interactions. Improved ecosystem models are necessary toots to reduce the uncertainty in the information that assists us in the sustainable management of our environment in a changing world.

@article{pringle_elephants_2008,
	Abstract = {Ecologists increasingly recognize the ability of certain species to influence ecological processes by engineering the physical environment, but efforts to develop a predictive understanding of this phenomenon are in their early stages. While many believe that the landscape-scale effects of ecosystem engineers will be to increase habitat diversity and therefore the abundance and richness of other species, few generalities exist about the effects of engineering at the scale of the engineered patch. According to one hypothesis, activities that increase structural habitat complexity within engineered patches will have positive effects on the abundance or diversity of other organisms. Here I show that, by damaging trees and increasing their structural complexity, browsing elephants create refuges used by a common arboreal lizard. Observational surveys and a lizard transplant experiment revealed that lizards preferentially occupy trees with real or simulated elephant damage. A second experiment showed that lizards vacate trees when elephant-engineered refuges are removed. Furthermore.. local lizard densities increased with (and may be constrained by) local densities of elephant-damaged trees. This facilitative effect of elephants upon lizards via patch-scale habitat modification runs contrary to previously documented negative effects of the entire ungulate guild on lizards at the landscape scale, suggesting that net indirect effects of large herbivores comprise opposing trophic and engineering interactions operating at different spatial scales. Such powerful megaherbivore-initiated interactions suggest that anthropogenic changes in large-mammal densities will have important cascading consequences for ecological communities.},

@article{poorter_role_2000,
	Abstract = {The allocation of biomass to different plant organs depends on species, ontogeny and on the environment experienced by the plant. In this paper we first discuss some methodological tools to describe and analyse the allocation of biomass. Rather than the use of shoot: root ratios, we plead strongly for a subdivision of biomass into at least three compartments: leaves, stems and roots. Attention is drawn to some of the disadvantages of allometry as a tool to correct for size differences between plants. Second, we tested the extent to which biomass allocation of plants follows the model of a 'functional equilibrium'. According to this model, plants respond to a decrease in above-ground resources with increased allocation to shoots (leaves), whereas they respond to a decrease in belowground resources with increased allocation to roots. We carried out a meta-analysis of the literature, analysing the effect of various environmental variables on the fraction of total plant biomass allocated to leaves (leaf mass fraction), stem (stem mass fraction) and roots (root mass fraction). The responses to light, nutrients and water agreed with the (qualitative) prediction of the 'functional equilibrium' theory. The notable exception was atmospheric CO2, which did not affect allocation when the concentration was doubled. Third, we analysed the quantitative importance of the changes in allocation compared to changes in other growth parameters, such as unit leaf rate (the net difference between carbon gain and carbon losses per unit time and leaf area), and specific leaf area (leaf area: leaf biomass). The effects of light, CO2 and water on leaf mass fractions were small compared to their effects on relative growth rate. The effects of nutrients, however, were large, suggesting that only in the case of nutrients, biomass allocation is a major factor in the response of plants to limiting resource supply.},

@article{smit_elephants_2007,
	Abstract = {In a recent paper we demonstrated that elephant bull groups and mixed herds exhibited spatial and resource segregation across the Kruger National Park. It was found, inter alia, that both bull groups and mixed herds occurred more frequently closer to rivers than expected if they were randomly distributed, but that only bull groups occurred more frequently closer to the artificial waterholes. Although Chamaille Jammes et al. ( 2007) accepted these results, they disagreed with our interpretation regarding the potential effect that closure of artificial waterholes might have. Here we address some of the specific concerns expressed and provide a broader context regarding water provision and elephant management. Although water provision can influence elephant density and distribution, we argue that the effectiveness of surface- water manipulation as a management tool will depend on ( 1) natural surface- water availability, ( 2) forage quality, ( 3) elephant densities, ( 4) position of a population on its growth trajectory, and ( 5) management objectives. Even though elephants are water- dependent, the effectiveness of water provision as a management tool will therefore be area- and population- specific and will depend on management objectives.},

	Abstract = {Climate change due to greenhouse gas emissions is predicted to raise the mean global temperature by 1.0-3.5\&\#176;C in the next 50-100 years. The direct and indirect effects of this potential increase in temperature on terrestrial ecosystems and ecosystem processes are likely to be complex and highly varied in time and space. The Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems core project of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme has recently launched a Network of Ecosystem Warming Studies, the goals of which are to integrate and foster research on ecosystem-level effects of rising temperature. In this paper, we use meta-analysis to synthesize data on the response of soil respiration, net N mineralization, and aboveground plant productivity to experimental ecosystem warming at 32 research sites representing four broadly defined biomes, including high (latitude or altitude) tundra, low tundra, grassland, and forest. Warming methods included electrical heat-resistance ground cables, greenhouses, vented and unvented field chambers, overhead infrared lamps, and passive night-time warming. Although results from individual sites showed considerable variation in response to warming, results from the meta-analysis showed that, across all sites and years, 2-9 years of experimental warming in the range 0.3-6.0\&\#176;C significantly increased soil respiration rates by 20\% (with a 95\% confidence interval of 18-22\%), net N mineralization rates by 46\% (with a 95\% confidence interval of 30-64\%), and plant productivity by 19\% (with a 95\% confidence interval of 15-23\%). The response of soil respiration to warming was generally larger in forested ecosystems compared to low tundra and grassland ecosystems, and the response of plant productivity was generally larger in low tundra ecosystems than in forest and grassland ecosystems. With the exception of aboveground plant productivity, which showed a greater positive response to warming in colder ecosystems, the magnitude of the response of these three processes to experimental warming was not generally significantly related to the geographic, climatic, or environmental variables evaluated in this analysis. This underscores the need to understand the relative importance of specific factors (such as temperature, moisture, site quality, vegetation type, successional status, land-use history, etc.) at different spatial and temporal scales, and suggests that we should be cautious in "scaling up" responses from the plot and site level to the landscape and biome level. Overall, ecosystem-warming experiments are shown to provide valuable insights on the response of terrestrial ecosystems to elevated temperature.},

	Abstract = {We analyzed the hydraulic constraints imposed on water uptake from soils of different porosities in loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) by comparing genetically related and even-aged plantations growing in loam versus sand soil. Water use was evaluated relative to the maximum transpiration rate (E crit) allowed by the soil-leaf continuum. We expected that trees on both soils would approach E crit during drought. Trees in sand, however, should face greater drought limitation because of steeply declining hydraulic conductivity in sand at high soil water potential (Ψ S). Transport considerations suggest that trees in sand should have higher root to leaf area ratios (A R:A L), less negative leaf xylem pressure (Ψ L), and be more vulnerable to xylem cavitation than trees in loam. The A R:A L was greater in sand versus loam (9.8 vs 1.7, respectively). This adjustment maintained about 86\% of the water extraction potential for both soils. Trees in sand were more deeply rooted ({\textgreater}1.9 m) than in loam (95\% of roots {\textless}0.2 m), allowing them to shift water uptake to deeper layers during drought and avoid hydraulic failure. Midday Ψ L was constant for days of high evaporative demand, but was less negative in sand (--1.6 MPa) versus loam (--2.1 MPa). Xylem was more vulnerable to cavitation in sand versus loam trees. Roots in both soils were more vulnerable than stems, and experienced the greatest predicted loss of conductivity during drought. Trees on both soils approached E crit during drought, but at much higher Ψ S in sand ({\textless}--0.4 MPa) than in loam ({\textless}--1.0 MPa). Results suggest considerable phenotypic plasticity in water use traits for P. taeda which are adaptive to differences in soil porosity.},

	Abstract = {We assess prey competition between various carnivore species that overlapped in time and geographic range during the Early to Late Pleistocene of Java, using a three step procedure. Our sample encompasses 5 carnivore species-two pantherines (Panthera tigris, P. pardus); a single hyaenid (Hyaena brevirostris); and two canid species (Cuon alpinus, Cuon (Mececyon) trinilensis)-each of which occurs in one or more faunal levels (Ci Saat, Trinil HK, Kedung Brubus, Ngandong, and Pinning) in the well-documented Stegodon-Homo erectus Fauna. The tiger is the only carnivore that occurs in all faunal levels studied here. Since changing body mass can lessen competition, monitoring tiger body mass through the chronological sequence-as other species enter or leave the fossil record-provides an opportunity to assess the effects of competition. First, we estimate body mass of each individual in these species using regression equations based on measurement of skeletal elements. Second step, from these estimates of individual body mass we derive prey focus masses (PFM) and prey mass spectra (PMS). Third, we examine pairwise PMS overlap of coexisting carnivore species, deriving a quantitative Competition Index (CI) that expresses the degree to which a specific carnivore is affected by the presence of another carnivore species. The Cl provides a measure of the consequences of changes in the carnivore communities upon each species and also allows us to evaluate the impact of different hunting strategies on competition. We suggest the significant increase in body mass of tigers in the Ngandong faunal level reflects unusually intense competition among carnivores in the preceding Kedung Brubus level.

	Abstract = {The factors controlling the extent of fire in Africa south of the equator were investigated using moderate resolution (500 m) satellite-derived burned area maps and spatial data on the environmental factors thought to affect burnt area. A random forest regression tree procedure was used to determine the relative importance of each factor in explaining the burned area fraction and to address hypotheses concerned with human and climatic influences on the drivers of burnt area. The model explained 68\% of the variance in burnt area. Tree cover, rainfall in the previous 2 years, and rainfall seasonality were the most important predictors. Human activities -- represented by grazing, roads per unit area, population density, and cultivation fraction -- were also shown to affect burnt area, but only in parts of the continent with specific climatic conditions, and often in ways counter to the prevailing wisdom that more human activity leads to more fire. The analysis found no indication that ignitions were limiting total burnt area on the continent, and most of the spatial variation was due to variation in fuel load and moisture. Split conditions from the regression tree identified (i) low rainfall regions, where fire is rare; (ii) regions where fire is under human control; and (iii) higher rainfall regions where burnt area is determined by rainfall seasonality. This study provides insights into the physical, climatic, and human drivers of fire and their relative importance across southern Africa, and represents the beginnings of a predictive framework for burnt area.},

We assessed WWF ecoregions against existing frameworks: (1) the Dasmann-Udvardy (World Conservation Union [IUCN]) Biogeographical Representation Framework, (2) the Bailey Ecoregional Framework (U.S. Forest Service), and (3) the hotspot approach, as exemplified by the BirdLife Endemic Bird Area Approach and the WWF-IUCN Centres of Plant Diversity Program. We examined the genealogy of the schemes from three perspectives: methodological explicitness, transparency and repeatability, and whether the WWF-ecoregions system improves on existing schemes. We considered Indonesia as a case study and assessed the efficacy of each system in the Indonesian context. The existing planning frameworks achieved their objective; in general had explicit, transparent, and repeatable methods; and, in the case of the Dasmann-Udvardy system, attained an institutional reality in Indonesia. The central purpose of the WWF-ecoregions framework is the same as the 25-year-old Dasmann-Udvardy system, and at the coarsest spatial scales it relies on similar spatial delineators (biomes and faunal regions). The WWF methodology, however, employs a gestalt approach to defining ecoregion boundaries. In the Indonesian context the resulting map appears problematic both in terms of the underlying rationale of the ecoregion approach and in terms of apparent conflict with preexisting protected-area design. To suggest, insofar as refined planning frameworks are needed, that an alternative route that builds oil rather than competes with existing approaches would be to combine at the mesoscale the landform delineators that characterize the Bailey ecoregion system with the existing macroscale ecoclimatic and biogeographic delineators of the Dasmann-Udvardy system. We question the investment in developing and promoting the WWF-ecoregion scheme in Indonesia when the existing Dasmann-Udvardy system, used in conjunction with hotspot studies, provides a seemingly adequate system and when the reserve system itself is under considerable pressure.},

	Abstract = {Tropical forests contain an important proportion of the carbon stored in terrestrial vegetation, but estimated aboveground biomass (AGB) in tropical forests varies two-fold, with little consensus on the relative importance of climate, soil and forest structure in explaining spatial patterns. Here, we present analyses from a plot network designed to examine differences among contrasting forest habitats (terra firme, seasonally flooded, and white-sand forests) that span the gradient of climate and soil conditions of the Amazon basin. We installed 0.5-ha plots in 74 sites representing the three lowland forest habitats in both Loreto, Peru and French Guiana, and we integrated data describing climate, soil physical and chemical characteristics and stand variables, including local measures of wood specific gravity (WSG). We use a hierarchical model to separate the contributions of stand variables from climate and soil variables in explaining spatial variation in AGB. AGB differed among both habitats and regions, varying from 78 Mg ha−1 in white-sand forest in Peru to 605 Mg ha−1 in terra firme clay forest of French Guiana. Stand variables including tree size and basal area, and to a lesser extent WSG, were strong predictors of spatial variation in AGB. In contrast, soil and climate variables explained little overall variation in AGB, though they did co-vary to a limited extent with stand parameters that explained AGB. Our results suggest that positive feedbacks in forest structure and turnover control AGB in Amazonian forests, with richer soils (Peruvian terra firme and all seasonally flooded habitats) supporting smaller trees with lower wood density and moderate soils (French Guianan terra firme) supporting many larger trees with high wood density. The weak direct relationships we observed between soil and climate variables and AGB suggest that the most appropriate approaches to landscape scale modeling of AGB in the Amazon would be based on remote sensing methods to map stand structure.},

	Abstract = {The net ecosystem exchange of CO2 between forests and the atmosphere, measured by eddy covariance, is the small difference between two large fluxes of photosynthesis and respiration. Chamber measurements of soil surface CO2 efflux (F-s), wood respiration (F-w,) and foliage respiration (F-f) help identify the contributions of these individual components to net ecosystem exchange. Models developed from the chamber data also provide independent estimates of respiration casts. We measured CO2 efflux with chambers periodically in 1996-97 in a ponderosa pine forest in Oregon, scaled these measurements to the ecosystem, and computed annual totals for respiration by component. We also compared estimated half-hourly ecosystem respiration at night (F-nc) with eddy covariance measurements. Mean foliage respiration normalized to 10 degrees C was 0.20 mu mol m(-2) (hemi-leaf surface area) s(-1), and reached a maximum of 0.24 mu mol m(-2) HSA s(-1) between days 162 and 208. Mean wood respiration normalized to 10 degrees C was 5.9 mu mol m(-3) sapwood s(-1), with slightly higher rates in mid-summer, when growth occurs. There was no significant difference (P {\textgreater} 0.10) between wood respiration of young (45 years) and old trees (250 years). Soil surface respiration normalized to 10 degrees C ranged from 0.7 to 3.0 mu mol m(-2) (ground) s(-1) from days 23 to 329, with the lowest rates in winter and highest rates in late spring. Annual CO2 flux from soil surface, foliage and wood was 683, 157, and 54 g C m(-2) y(-1), with soil fluxes responsible for 76\% of ecosystem respiration. The ratio of net primary production to gross primary production was 0.45, consistent with values for conifer sites in Oregon and Australia, but higher than values reported for boreal coniferous forests. Below-ground carbon allocation (root turnover and respiration, estimated as F-s,litterfall carbon) consumed 61\% of GPP; high ratios such as this are typical of sites with more water and nutrient constraints. The chamber estimates were moderately correlated with change in CO2 storage in the canopy (F-stor) on calm nights (friction velocity u* {\textless} 0.25 m s(-1); R-2 = 0.60); F-stor was not significantly different from summed chamber estimates. On windy nights (u* {\textgreater} 0.25 m s(-1)), the sum of turbulent flux measured above the canopy by eddy covariance and Fstor Was only weakly correlated with summed chamber estimates (R-2 = 0.14); the eddy covariance estimates were lower than chamber estimates by 50\%.},

@article{deutschman_error_1999,
	Abstract = {A central challenge in ecology is understanding the emergence of broad-scale community and ecosystem patterns as the result of interactions among individuals. We identify the role of fine-scale light heterogeneity in controlling broad-scale community behavior in SORTIE, an empirically derived, stochastic forest simulation model. SORTIE employs a very detailed measure of local light based on a 216-point sample around every tree. We test the importance of this fine-scale description of local light by reformulating SORTIE with less detail in this algorithm. Predicted forests are compared at several scales from total tree biomass (coarse grained) and patterns of forest succession to the local spatial pattern of light availability at the forest floor (fine grained). SORTIE is surprisingly insensitive to the amount of detail used in the calculation of the local resource, light. In all simulations, 48- and 16-point samples accurately reproduce the local light environment and thus predict forest development without appreciable error. A one-point sample of light significantly alters the estimates of the local light environment, but the emergent forest dynamics are insensitive to these alterations. The robustness of the forest model to the altered light environment stems from two very different mechanisms. First, the alterations of the light environment have very short correlation lengths in time and space. This allows fine-scale averaging to occur on the landscape. Second, the functional relationships among light availability, growth rate, and mortality risk in several key species tend to prevent the altered light environment from affecting individual tree performance. These results demonstrate that emergent forest dynamics in SORTIE do nor require detailed local light estimation to capture the interaction between local resource heterogeneity and the functional responses of trees. In addition, we have shown that comparing model predictions at several scales provides a strong methodology to identify relevant detail and understand scaling in this model of a forest.},

	Abstract = {Group foraging allows individuals (scroungers) to obtain food discovered by others (producers). Producer-scrounger game models typically overlook the costs and benefits of patch exploitation, assuming instead that producers and scroungers abandon patches simultaneously once depletion occurs. Here we develop an extension of the marginal value theorem of patch exploitation that includes the producer-scrounger dynamics and examine the propensity of a producer to abandon its patch before depletion once scroungers arrive. We predict that early departures should occur more often when expected searching time decreases and when competition intensity in the patch increases. Competition intensity is expected to increase when more scroungers are present or when patches are smaller. We tested these predictions using a within-subject experimental design with six captive flocks of spice finches (Lonchura punctulata), each composed of one producer and three scroungers. As predicted, producers abandoned their food discoveries more frequently once scroungers arrived when searching time was short, when more scroungers were present, and when patches were small. The results show that the producers of a patch often leave as scroungers join their food discoveries because the payoffs from leaving exceed those from staying},

@article{williams_dynamical_2006,
	Abstract = {In this study, we extend a model of daily dryland dynamics by parameterizing a modified version of a minimalistic annual model to examine how the statistical structure of annual rainfall and grazing intensity interact to influence dryland vegetation. With a Monte Carlo approach, an ensemble outcome provides a statistical description of likely dryland vegetation dynamics responding to variations in rainfall structure and grazing intensity. Results suggest that increased rainfall variability decreases the average and increases the variability of grass cover leading to more frequent degradation of the grass resource. Vegetation of drier regions is found to be more sensitive to interannual variability in rainfall. Concentrating this variability into an organized periodic mode further decreases the mean and increases the variability of grass cover. Hence, a shift toward lower, more variable, or more inter-annually correlated annual rainfall will likely lead to a general decrease in the grass resource and increased dryland vulnerability to degradation. Higher grazing intensity or lower annual rainfall both lead to more frequent and longer duration degradation of the grass condition. We note an interesting interaction in the response of grass biomass to grazing intensity and rainfall variability, where increased rainfall variability leads to longer duration degradation for low grazing, but shorter periods of degradation for high grazing. Once grass reaches a degraded condition, we find that woody vegetation strongly suppresses recovery even if successive rainfall is high. Overall, these findings suggest that the projected increase in interannual rainfall variability will likely decrease grass cover and potentially lead to more frequent, longer lasting degradation of dryland vegetation, particularly if enhanced rainfall variability is concentrated in long period (e.g. decadal) modes.},

	Abstract = {Vultures, the only vertebrate obligate scavengers, are currently facing a dramatic worldwide decline with over half of vulture species now classified as threatened. To address this widespread decline, the use of feeding stations has been widely advocated in recovery programs. However, providing food that is more predictable in time and space than natural resources could disrupt the ecological scavenging service provided by vultures. In this study, we build a multi-agent system (MAS), which describes the social foraging behavior of Gyps vultures in order to investigate how resource predictability in space and resource management affect scavenging service efficiency. We study the possibility that vultures take into account feeding station location in addition of using local enhancement. Our results show that the efficiency of the scavenging service is heavily affected by the way resources are distributed between feeding stations and natural areas. Nevertheless, it appears possible to minimize a loss in service efficiency by increasing the number of feeding stations while keeping the total amount of resources available constant, thus reducing the predictability of the resources located on the stations. We illustrate our work in the case of European feeding stations that provide supplementary resources in areas where natural ones are scarce. Moreover, we discuss the implications worldwide, in particular in the case of India, where feeding stations for vultures are intended to lure individuals away from potentially harmful natural carrion.},

	Abstract = {The effects of increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations on vegetative growth and competitive performance were evaluated, using five meta-analyses. Paying special attention to functional groups, we analysed responses at three integration levels: carbon economy parameters, vegetative biomass of isolated plants, and growth in competition. CO2 effects on seed biomass and plant-to-plant variability were also studied. Underlying the growth stimulation is an increased unit leaf rate (ULR), especially for herbaceous dicots. This is mainly caused by an increase in the whole-plant rate of photosynthesis. The increased ULR is accompanied by a decrease in specific leaf area. The net result of these and other changes is that relative growth rate is only marginally stimulated. The biomass enhancement ratio (BER) of individually grown plants varies substantially across experiments/species, and size variability in the experimental populations is a vital factor in this. Fast-growing herbaceous C3 species respond more strongly than slow-growing C3 herbs or C4 plants. CAM species and woody plants show intermediate responses. When grown in competition, C4 species show lowest responses to elevated CO2 at high nutrient conditions, whereas at low nutrient levels N-2-fixing dicots respond relatively strongly. No systematic differences were found between slow- and fast-growing species. BER values obtained for isolated plants cannot be used to estimate BER of the same species grown in interspecific competitionthe CO2 response of monocultures may be a better predictor.},

Abstract
Many studies in recent years have investigated the effects of climate change on the future of biodiversity. In this review, we first examine the different possible effects of climate change that can operate at individual, population, species, community, ecosystem and biome scales, notably showing that species can respond to climate change challenges by shifting their climatic niche along three non-exclusive axes: time (e.g. phenology), space (e.g. range) and self (e.g. physiology). Then, we present the principal specificities and caveats of the most common approaches used to estimate future biodiversity at global and sub-continental scales and we synthesise their results. Finally, we highlight several challenges for future research both in theoretical and applied realms. Overall, our review shows that current estimates are very variable, depending on the method, taxonomic group, biodiversity loss metrics, spatial scales and time periods considered. Yet, the majority of models indicate alarming consequences for biodiversity, with the worst-case scenarios leading to extinction rates that would qualify as the sixth mass extinction in the history of the earth.},

	Abstract = {C-4 photosynthesis is an adaptation derived from the more common C-3 photosynthetic pathway that confers a higher productivity under warm temperature and low atmospheric CO2 concentration [1, 2]. C-4 evolution has been seen as a consequence of past atmospheric CO2 decline, such as the abrupt CO2 fall 32-25 million years ago (Mya) [3-6]. This relationship has never been tested rigorously, mainly because of a lack of accurate estimates of divergence times for the different C-4 lineages [3]. In this study, we inferred a large phylogenetic tree for the grass family and estimated, through Bayesian molecular dating, the ages of the 17 to 18 independent grass C4 lineages. The first transition from C-3 to C-4 photosynthesis occurred in the Chloridoideae subfamily, 32.0-25.0 Mya. The link between CO2 decrease and transition to C-4 photosynthesis was tested by a novel maximum likelihood approach. We showed that the model incorporating the atmospheric CO2 levels was significantly better than the null model, supporting the importance Of CO2 decline on C-4 photosynthesis evolvability. This finding is relevant for understanding the origin Of C-4 photosynthesis in grasses, which is one of the most successful ecological and evolutionary innovations in plant history.},

	Abstract = {Atmospheric CO2 concentrations have increased dramatically over the last century and continuing increases are expected to have significant, though currently unpredictable, effects on ecosystems. One important process that may be affected by elevated CO2 is leaf litter decomposition. We investigated the interactions among atmospheric CO2, herbivory, and litter quality within a scrub oak community at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. Leaf litter chemistry in 16 plots of open-top chambers was followed for 3 years; eight were exposed to ambient levels of CO2, and eight were exposed to elevated levels of CO2 (ambient + 350 ppmV). We focused on three dominant oak species, Quercus geminata, Quercus myrtifolia, and Quercus chapmanii. Condensed tannin concentrations in oak leaf litter were higher under elevated CO2. Litter chemistry differed among all plant species except for condensed tannins. Phenolic concentrations were lower, whereas lignin concentrations and lignin/nitrogen ratios were higher in herbivore-damaged litter independent of CO2 concentration. However, changes in litter chemistry from year to year were far larger than effects of CO2 or insect damage, suggesting that these may have only minor effects on litter decomposition.},

@article{canadell_maximum_1996,
	Abstract = {The depth at which plants are able to grow roots has important implications for the whole ecosystem hydrological balance, as well as for carbon and nutrient cycling. Here we summarize what we know about the maximum rooting depth of species belonging to the major terrestrial biomes. We found 290 observations of maximum rooting depth in the literature which covered 253 woody and herbaceous species. Maximum rooting depth ranged from 0.3 m for some tundra species to 68 m for Boscia albitrunca in the central Kalahari; 194 species had roots at least 2 m deep, 50 species had roots at a depth of 5 m or more, and 22 species had roots as deep as 10 m or more. The average for the globe was 4.6$\pm$0.5 m. Maximum rooting depth by biome was 2.0$\pm$0.3 m for boreal forest. 2.1$\pm$0.2 m for cropland, 9.5$\pm$2.4 m for desert, 5.2$\pm$0.8 m for sclerophyllous shrubland and forest, 3.9$\pm$0.4 m for temperate coniferous forest, 2.9$\pm$0.2 m for temperate deciduous forest, 2.6$\pm$0.2 m for temperate grassland, 3.7$\pm$0.5 m for tropical deciduous forest, 7.3$\pm$2.8 m for tropical evergreen forest, 15.0$\pm$5.4 m for tropical grassland/savanna, and 0.5$\pm$0.1 m for tundra. Grouping all the species across biomes (except croplands) by three basic functional groups: trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants, the maximum rooting depth was 7.0$\pm$1.2 m for trees, 5.1$\pm$0.8 m for shrubs, and 2.6$\pm$0.1 m for herbaceous plants. These data show that deep root habits are quite common in woody and herbaceous species across most of the terrestrial biomes, far deeper than the traditional view has held up to now. This finding has important implications for a better understanding of ecosystem function and its application in developing ecosystem models.},

	Abstract = {Three radiation models are compared. They are the two-stream approximation, Goudriaan's radiation model and Beer's law. If direct beam and diffuse radiation are considered separately with the appropriate extinction coefficients, Beer's law can be used to estimate the fraction of absorbed visible radiation quite accurately, as compared with the other two models. However, Beer's law always overestimates the fraction of absorbed near-infrared radiation because of the significant loss of scattered radiation in the near-infrared radiation waveband; the error can be up to 50\%, compared with the two-stream approximation. The error is systematic and is not reduced by integrating over a day or longer. It can be even larger if absorption of direct beam and diffuse radiation are not considered separately. Compared with the two-stream approximation, Goudriaan's model underestimates the amount of absorbed visible and near-infrared radiation, and consequently net photosynthesis, and overestimates sensible heat fluxes of the canopy when Goudriaan's model is used to estimate the amount of radiation absorbed by sunlit and shaded leaves within a canopy in the CSIRO Biosphere Model. However, the mean differences in the calculated hourly fluxes of net canopy photosynthesis, latent and sensible heat are less than 5\% for a wheat crop during the whole growing season.},

@article{diekmann_steady-state_2003,
	Abstract = {Our systematic formulation of nonlinear population models is based on the notion of the environmental condition. The defining property of the environmental condition is that individuals are independent of one another (and hence equations are linear) when this condition is prescribed (in principle as an arbitrary function of time, but when focussing on steady states we shall restrict to constant functions). The steady-state problem has two components: (i) the environmental condition should be such that the existing populations do neither grow nor decline; (ii) a feedback consistency condition relating the environmental condition to the community/population size and composition should hold. In this paper we develop, justify and analyse basic formalism under the assumption that individuals can be born in only finitely many possible states and that the environmental condition is fully characterized by finitely many numbers. The theory is illustrated by many examples. In addition to various simple toy models introduced for explanation purposes, these include a detailed elaboration of a cannibalism model and a general treatment of how genetic and physiological structure should be combined in a single model.

@article{scheffer_super-individuals_1995,
	Abstract = {Modelling populations on an individual-by-individual basis has proven to be a fruitful approach. Many complex patterns that are observed on the population level have been shown to arise from simple interactions between individuals. However, a major problem with these models is that the typically large number of individuals needed requires impractically large computation times. The common solution, reduction of the number of individuals in the model, can lead to loss of variation, irregular dynamics, and large sensitivity to the value of random generator seeds. As a solution to these problems, we propose to add an extra variable feature to each model individual, namely the number of real individuals it actually represents. This approach allows zooming from a real individual-by-individual model to a cohort representation or ultimately an all-animals-are-equal view without changing the model formulation. Therefore, the super-individual concept offers easy possibilities to check whether the observed behaviour is an artifact of following a limited number of individuals or of lumping individuals, and also to verify whether individual variability is indeed an essential ingredient for the observed behaviour. In addition the approach offers arbitrarily large computational advantages. As an example the super-individual approach is applied to a generic model of the dynamics of a size-distributed consumer cohort as well as to an elaborate applied simulation model of the recruitment of striped bass.},

@article{hagemann_improving_2003,
	Abstract = {In this study it is shown that the availability of a very high resolution dataset of land surface characteristics leads to the improvement of a surface runoff parameterization scheme. The improved parameterization scheme was developed for application in global and regional climate models and is a further development of the Arno scheme that is widely used in climate models. Here, surface runoff is computed as infiltration excess from a "bucket" type reservoir which takes the subgrid variability of soil saturation within a model gridbox into account. Instead of prescribing a distribution of subgrid scale soil water capacities as in the original Arno scheme, the array of high resolution soil water capacities taken from a global 1 km dataset of land surface parameters is used to obtain individual fractional saturation curves for each model gridbox. From each saturation curve, the three parameters (a shape parameter describing the shape of the subgrid distribution of soil water capacities, subgrid minimum and maximum soil water capacity) required in the modified formulation of the scheme are derived via optimization. As in the original Arno scheme applied in the ECHAM general circulation model and the REMO regional climate model, topography variations will influence the distribution of saturated subgrid areas within a model gridbox. At most gridboxes the net effect of these changes is such that more runoff is produced for high soil water contents and less runoff for low soil water contents. A validation of simulated discharge computed with a simplified land surface scheme applied to reanalysis data of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and a hydrological discharge model has shown that these changes lead to a more realistic simulation of the annual cycle of discharge for several catchments. In particular this could be shown for the Yangtze Kiang and Amur catchments where adequate input data are available.},

	Abstract = {The emergence of C-4 grass biomes is believed to have first taken place in the upper Miocene, when a series of events modified global climate with long-lasting impacts on continental biotas. Changes included major shifts in floral composition-characterized in Africa by shrinking of forests and emergence of C-4 grasses and more open landscapes - followed by large-scale evolutionary shifts in faunal communities. The timing of the emergence of C-4 grasses, and the subsequent global expansion of C-4 grass-dominated biomes, however, is disputed, leading to contrasting views of the patterns of environmental changes and their links to faunal shifts, including those of early hominins. Here we evaluate the existing isotopic evidence available for central, eastern, and southern Africa, and review interpretations in light of these data. Pedogenic and biomineral carbonate delta C-13 data suggest that clear evidence for C-4 biomass in low latitudes exists only from 7-8 Ma. This likely postdates the emergence of C-4 plants, whose physiology is adapted to low atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Biomes with C-4 grasses appeared later in mid-latitude sites. Moreover, C-4 grasses apparently remained a relatively minor component of most environments until the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene. Hence establishment of C-4 grasses, even as minor components of African biomes, precedes the very earliest evidence for bipedalism by two million years, and the more abundant and secure evidence by some three to four million years. This may suggest a protracted process of hominin adaptation to these emerging, more open landscapes. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{hickler_implementing_2006,
	Abstract = {Aim To implement plant hydraulic architecture within the Lund--Potsdam--Jena Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (LPJ--DGVM), and to test the model against a set of observational data. If the model can reproduce major patterns in vegetation and ecosystem processes, we consider this to be an important linkage between plant physiology and larger-scale ecosystem dynamics.Location The location is global, geographically distributed.Methods A literature review was carried out to derive model formulations and parameter values for representing the hydraulic characteristics of major global plant functional types (PFTs) in a DGVM. After implementing the corresponding formulations within the LPJ--DGVM, present-day model output was compared to observational data.Results The model reproduced observed broad-scale patterns in potential natural vegetation, but it failed to distinguish accurately between different types of grassland and savanna vegetation, possibly related to inadequate model representations of water fluxes in the soil and wildfire effects. Compared to a version of the model using an empirical formulation for calculating plant water supply without considering plant hydraulic architecture, the new formulation improved simulated patterns of vegetation in particular for dry shrublands. Global-scale simulation results for runoff and actual evapotranspiration (AET) corresponded well to available data. The model also successfully reproduced the magnitude and seasonal cycle of AET for most EUROFLUX forests, while modelled variation in NPP across a large number of sites spanning several biomes showed a strong correlation with estimates from field measurements.Main conclusions The model was generally confirmed by comparison to observational data. The novel model representation of water flow within plants makes it possible to resolve mechanistically the effects of hydraulic differences between plant functional groups on vegetation structure, water cycling, and competition. This may be an advantage when predicting ecosystem responses to nonextant climates, in particular in areas dominated by dry shrubland vegetation.},

@article{osborne_atmosphere_2008,
	Abstract = {1. Grasses using the C-4 photosynthetic pathway dominate today's savanna ecosystems and account for similar to 20\% of terrestrial carbon fixation. However, this dominant status was reached only recently, during a period of C-4 grassland expansion in the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene (4-8 Myr ago). Declining atmospheric CO2 has long been considered the key driver of this event, but new geological evidence casts doubt on the idea, forcing a reconsideration of the environmental cues for C-4 plant success. 2. Here, I evaluate the current hypotheses and debate in this field, beginning with a discussion of the role of CO2 in the evolutionary origins, rather than expansion, of C-4 grasses. Atmospheric CO2 starvation is a plausible selection agent for the C-4 pathway, but a time gap of around 10 Myr remains between major decreases in CO2 during the Oligocene, and the earliest current evidence Of C-4 plants. 3. An emerging ecological perspective explains the Miocene expansion of C-4 grasslands via changes in climatic seasonality and the occurrence of fire. However, the climatic drivers of this event are debated and may vary among geographical regions. 4. Uncertainty in these areas could be reduced significantly by new directions in ecological research, especially the discovery that grass species richness along rainfall gradients shows contrasting patterns in different C-4 clades. By re-evaluating a published data set, I show that increasing seasonality of rainfall is linked to changes in the relative abundance of the major C-4 grass clades Paniceae and Andropogoneae. I propose that the explicit inclusion of these ecological patterns would significantly strengthen climate change hypotheses of Miocene C-4 grassland expansion. Critically, they allow a new series of testable predictions to be made about the fossil record. 5. Synthesis. This paper offers a novel framework for integrating modern ecological patterns into theories about the geological history of C-4 plants.},

	Abstract = {How tropical forest carbon stocks might alter in response to changes in climate and atmospheric composition is uncertain. However, assessing potential future carbon loss from tropical forests is important for evaluating the efficacy of programmes for reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation. Uncertainties are associated with different carbon stock responses in models with different representations of vegetation processes on the one hand, and differences in projected changes in temperature and precipitation patterns on the other hand. Here we present a systematic exploration of these sources of uncertainty, along with uncertainty arising from different emissions scenarios for all three main tropical forest regions: the Americas (that is, Amazonia and Central America), Africa and Asia. Using simulations with 22 climate models and the MOSES--TRIFFID land surface scheme, we find that only in one of the simulations are tropical forests projected to lose biomass by the end of the twenty-first century---and then only for the Americas. When comparing with alternative models of plant physiological processes, we find that the largest uncertainties are associated with plant physiological responses, and then with future emissions scenarios. Uncertainties from differences in the climate projections are significantly smaller. Despite the considerable uncertainties, we conclude that there is evidence of forest resilience for all three regions.},

	Abstract = {Knowledge of the evolution of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations throughout the Earth's history is important for a reconstruction of the links between climate and radiative forcing of the Earth's surface temperatures. Although atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations in the early Cenozoic era (about 60 Myr ago) are widely believed to have been higher than at present, there is disagreement regarding the exact carbon dioxide levels, the timing of the decline and the mechanisms that are most important for the control of CO2 concentrations over geological timescales. Here we use the boron-isotope ratios of ancient planktonic foraminifer shells to estimate the pH of surface-layer sea water throughout the past 60 million years, which can be used to reconstruct atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We estimate CO2 concentrations of more than 2,000 p.p.m. for the late Palaeocene and earliest Eocene periods (from about 60 to 52 Myr ago), and rnd an erratic decline between 55 and 40 Myr ago that may have been caused by reduced CO2 outgassing from ocean ridges, volcanoes and metamorphic belts and increased carbon burial. Since the early Miocene (about 24 Myr ago), atmospheric CO2 concentrations appear to have remained below 500 p.p.m. and were more stable than before, although transient intervals of CO2 reduction may have occurred during periods of rapid cooling approximately 15 and 3 Myr ago.},

@article{smout_functional_2010,
	Abstract = {Predators can have profound impacts on the dynamics of their prey that depend on how predator consumption is affected by prey density (the predator's functional response). Consumption by a generalist predator is expected to depend on the densities of all its major prey species (its multispecies functional response, or MSFR), but most studies of generalists have focussed on their functional response to only one prey species.



Using Bayesian methods, we fit an MSFR to field data from an avian predator (the hen harrier Circus cyaneus) feeding on three different prey species. We use a simple graphical approach to show that ignoring the effects of alternative prey can give a misleading impression of the predator's effect on the prey of interest. For example, in our system, a ``predator pit'' for one prey species only occurs when the availability of other prey species is low.



The Bayesian approach is effective in fitting the MSFR model to field data. It allows flexibility in modelling over-dispersion, incorporates additional biological information into the parameter priors, and generates estimates of uncertainty in the model's predictions. These features of robustness and data efficiency make our approach ideal for the study of long-lived predators, for which data may be sparse and management/conservation priorities pressing.},

	Abstract = {We develop statistical methods appropriate for the analysis of spatially structured population data. The methods are used to study the structure and dynamics of a four-species annual plant guild recorded in 1,000 permanent squares over a 10-yr period. We parameterize models that predict population density from one year to the next. In agreement with theoretical expectation all the models have locally stable equilibria, and overcompensation is rare. We demonstrate that interspecific interactions are extremely weak, relative to intraspecific ones, and that the spatial arrangement of species and individuals within them is critical to the observed dynamics. The impact of spatial density-dependent population growth on observed densities was calculated. In 52\% of the cases population size would have been increased by at least a factor of 1.5 had there been no interactions between individuals, and in 9\% of these it would have increased by a factor of four or more. This effect is shown to be largely a result of intraspecific interactions. We discuss possible explanations for the weakness of interspecific interactions.},

The hydraulic architecture of trees can limit their water relations, gas exchange throughout the crown of trees, the distribution of trees over different habitats and, perhaps, even the maximum height that a particular species can achieve. Parameters of particular importance include: (1) the vulnerability of stems to drought-induced cavitation events because cavitation reduces the hydraulic conductance of stems, (2) the leaf specific conductivity-of stems because it determines the pressure gradients and most negative water potentials needed to sustain evaporation from leaves, (3) the water storage capacity of tissues because this might determine the ability of trees to survive long drought periods. All of these parameters are determined by the structure and function of anatomical components of trees. Some of the ecological and physiological trade-offs of specific structures are discussed.},

@article{chamaille-jammes_managing_2007,
	Abstract = {1. Concerns over the ecological impacts of high African elephant Loxodonta africana densities suggest that it may be necessary to control their numbers locally, although the best management approach is still widely debated. Artificial water supply is believed to be a major cause of local overabundance, and could be used as a potential tool to regulate elephant distribution and impact across landscapes, but its effect on elephants at the population scale has never been studied. 2. We assessed how dry-season surface-water availability constrained the distribution of an entire elephant population, using aerial and waterhole census data from Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. The study was initiated in 1986, when the population was released from culling. We studied how artificial waterholes, holding water throughout the dry season, and vegetation production, estimated from a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), influenced the long-term distribution of elephant densities. We also investigated how the elephant distribution responded to changes in population density and annual rainfall, a driver of surface-water availability. 3. Long-term dry-season elephant densities across the park tended to increase with vegetation production, and increased asymptotically with the density of artificial waterholes. 4. Since the culling stopped, dry-season elephant densities have increased in most areas of the park, except in areas of low vegetation production and low water availability. Interannual fluctuations in elephant distribution are linked to rainfall variability through its effect on surface-water availability. During dry years elephants concentrated in areas where artificial pumping maintained surface-water availability during the dry season. 5. During dry years elephant numbers at waterholes increased because of reduced surface-water availability, and elephants were distributed more evenly across waterholes, although active waterholes were unevenly distributed across the park. 6. Synthesis and applications. Surface-water availability drives the distribution and abundance of elephants within Hwange National Park, and therefore appears to be at the heart of the trade-off between elephant conservation and the extent of their impact on ecosystems. Artificial manipulation of surface water is one of the tools available for the management of elephant populations and should not be overlooked when considering options for controlling elephant numbers in places where they are considered to be overabundant.},

@article{roos_emergent_2003,
	Abstract = {Top predators that forage in a purely exploitative manner on smaller stages of a size-structured prey population have been shown to exhibit an Allee effect. This Allee effect emerges from the changes that predators induce in the prey-population size distribution and represents a feedback of predator density on its own performance, in which the feedback operates through and is modified by the life history of the prey. We demonstrate that these emergent Allee effects will occur only if the prey, in the absence of predators, is regulated by density dependence in development through one of its juvenile stages, as opposed to regulation through adult fecundity. In particular, for an emergent Allee effect to occur, over-compensation is required in the maturation rate out of the regulating juvenile stage, such that a decrease in juvenile density will increase the total maturation rate to larger/older stages. If this condition is satisfied, predators with negative size selection, which forage on small prey, exhibit an emergent Allee effect, as do predators with positive size selection, which forage on large adult prey. By contrast, predators that forage on juveniles in the regulating stage never exhibit emergent Allee effects. We conclude that the basic life-history characteristics of many species make them prone to exhibiting emergent Allee effects, resulting in an increased likelihood that communities possess alternative stable states or exhibit catastrophic shifts in structure and dynamics.},

@article{magnani_age-related_2000,
	Abstract = {The decline in above-ground net primary productivity (Pa) that is usually observed in forest stands has been variously attributed to respiration, nutrient or hydraulic limitations. A novel model is proposed to explain the phenomenon and the co-occurring changes in the balance between foliage, conducting sapwood and fine roots. The model is based on the hypothesis that a functional homeostasis in water transport is maintained irrespective of age: hydraulic resistances through the plant must be finely tuned to transpiration rates so as to avoid extremely negative water potentials that could result in diffuse xylem embolism and foliage dieback, in agreement with experimental evidence. As the plant grows taller, allocation is predicted to shift from foliage to transport tissues, most notably to fine roots. Higher respiration and fine root turnover would result in the observed decline in Pa. The predictions of the model have been compared with experimental data from a chronosequence of Pinus sylvestris stands. The observed reduction in Pa is conveniently explained by concurrent modifications in leaf area index and plant structure. Changes in allometry and shoot hydraulic conductance with age are successfully predicted by the principle of functional homeostasis.},

@article{moorcroft_method_2001,
	Abstract = {The problem of scale has been a critical impediment to incorporating important fine-scale processes into global ecosystem models. Our knowledge of fine-scale physiological and ecological processes comes from a variety of measurements, ranging from forest plot inventories to remote sensing, made at spatial resolutions considerably smaller than the large scale at which global ecosystem models are defined. In this paper, we describe a new individual-based, terrestrial biosphere model, which we label the ecosystem demography model (ED). We then introduce a general method for scaling stochastic individual-based models of ecosystem dynamics (gap models) such as ED to large scales. The method accounts for the fine-scale spatial heterogeneity within an ecosystem caused by stochastic disturbance events, operating at scales down to individual canopy-tree-sized gaps. By conditioning appropriately on the occurrence of these events, we derive a size- and age-structured (SAS) approximation for the first moment of the stochastic ecosystem model. With this approximation, it is possible to make predictions about the large scales of interest from a description of the fine-scale physiological and population-dynamic processes without simulating the fate of every plant individually. We use the SAS approximation to implement our individual-based biosphere model over South America from 15$\,^{\circ}$ N to 15$\,^{\circ}$ S, showing that the SAS equations are accurate across a range of environmental conditions and resulting ecosystem types. We then compare the predictions of the biosphere model to regional data and to intensive data at specific sites. Analysis of the model at these sites illustrates the importance of fine-scale heterogeneity in governing large-scale ecosystem function, showing how population and community-level processes influence ecosystem composition and structure, patterns of aboveground carbon accumulation, and net ecosystem production.},

The common practice so far has been to examine alternative assembly theories using dichotomist approaches of the form neutrality versus niche, or compensatory dynamics versus environmental forcing. In reality, all these mechanisms will be operating, albeit with different strengths. While there have been different approaches to community structure and dynamics, including neutrality and niche differentiation, less work has gone into separating out the temporal variation in species abundances into relative contributions from different components. Here we use a refined statistical machinery to decompose temporal fluctuations in species abundances into contributions from environmental stochasticity and inter-/intraspecific interactions, to see which ones dominate. We apply the methodology to community data from a range of taxa. Our results show that communities are largely driven by environmental fluctuations, and that member populations are, to different extents, regulated through intraspecific interactions, the effects of interspecific interactions remaining broadly minor. By decomposing the temporal variation in this way, we have been able to show directly what has been previously inferred indirectly: compensatory dynamics are in fact largely outweighed by environmental forcing, and the latter tends to synchronize the population dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Allee effects, strongly related to the extinction vulnerability of populations and gradually becoming acknowledged by both theoretically oriented and applied ecologists, have already been shown to have important roles in the dynamics of many populations. Although not yet widely recognized, two or more Allee effects can occur simultaneously in the same population. Here, we review the evidence for multiple Allee effects and show that their interactions can take several forms, many of which are far from inconsequential. We suggest that more research is needed to assess the prevalence and interactions of multiple Allee effects, as failing to take them into account could have adverse consequences for the management of threatened or exploited populations.},

	Abstract = {To reduce elephant densities and preserve biological diversity, 14,629 elephants were culled from Kruger National Park, South Africa (1967-1999). Data were catalogued between 1975 and 1996 on 2737 male and female elephants, including pregnancy and lactational status for 1620 females ({\textgreater}= 5 years of age) and, uterine and/or ovarian characteristics for 1279. This study used these data to investigate the effects of age and precipitation on reproduction. The youngest age of conception was 8 years (n = 6) and by 12 years of age all females were sexually mature. From the age of 14 years, the percentage of reproductively active females (pregnant and/or lactating) was {\textgreater} 90\%; however, this percentage declined when females reached 50 years of age. Overall, one-tenth of females were nonreproductive (not pregnant or lactating) at any given time, mostly in the youngest ({\textless} 15 years) and oldest ({\textgreater} 50 years) age classes. Eighteen (3.3\%) of the nonpregnant females had reproductive tract pathologies, including endometrial, uterine or ovarian cysts. There was a seasonal distribution of mating activity that correlated with the rainy season. As has been demonstrated in other populations of free-ranging African elephants, most of the females in Kruger National Park were reproductively active; however, age and climate affected reproductive activity. Pour rEduire la densitE des ElEphants et prEserver la diversitE biologique, 14.629 ElEphants ont EtE abattus dans le Parc National Kruger, en Afrique du Sud, entre 1967 et 1999.

@article{carreno-rocabado_effects_2012,
	Abstract = {* Disturbances are widespread and may affect community assembly, species composition, (functional) diversity and hence ecosystem processes. It remains still unclear to what extent disturbance-mediated species changes scale-up to changes in community functional properties, especially for species-rich tropical forests. * A large-scale field experiment was performed in which the dynamics of 15 000 stems {\textgreater}10 cm in diameter was monitored for 8 years in 44 one-ha forest plots. Twelve functional effect and response traits were measured for the most dominant tree species. The effects of different intensities of disturbance caused by logging and silvicultural treatments on the species and functional diversity of a Bolivian tropical forest community were evaluated, along with how these changes were driven by underlying demographic processes. * Disturbance treatments did not affect species diversity or functional diversity indices based on multiple traits related to primary productivity and decomposition rate. This result suggests that species richness is conserved, and trait variation is maintained, which can buffer the community against environmental change. * In contrast, disturbance intensity affected the average plant trait values in the community (the community-weighted mean) for seven of 12 traits evaluated. At high disturbance intensity, the community had a lower wood density of stem and branches, lower leaf toughness and dry matter content, but higher specific leaf area and leaf N- and P concentration, with the value of these traits changing on average 6\% over the 8-year period. The functional spectrum of the community changed, therefore, from `slow', conservative, shade-tolerant species towards `fast', acquisitive, light-demanding species. These functional changes in mean trait values may enhance primary productivity and decomposition rate in the short term. * Temporal changes in community functional properties were mainly driven by recruitment, and little by mortality or survival. * Synthesis. Moderate levels of (logging) disturbance neither affected species diversity nor functional diversity per se in the 8-year period after logging. Disturbance did, however, change the functional community composition towards `fast' species with more acquisitive traits, thus potentially fuelling primary productivity and nutrient and carbon cycling. In conclusion, tropical forest management may contribute to conserving functional biodiversity of trees while providing forest resources.},

An integrated Geographical Information System (GIS)-Spatially Explicit Population Dynamics Model (SEPM) for investigating the dynamics of red squirrel Sciurus vulgaris and grey squirrel S. carolinensis populations in different landscapes is described. 2. Using the model, we simulated processes of reproduction, mortality and dispersal in individual populations of squirrels in habitat blocks identified within a GIS. We modelled dispersal as a process whereby individual animals moved between blocks of habitat separated by areas of unsuitable habitat. An interference model simulating the effects of competition between the grey and red squirrels was incorporated where both species occupied the same habitat blocks. 3. The model was used to investigate the spread of grey squirrels and its impact on the distribution of red squirrels in Norfolk, UK, where historical information on the decline in the red squirrel and the expansion of the grey squirrel were available. 4. We examined the effect of a range of life history scenarios differing in terms of adult mortality, juvenile mortality, fecundity, habitat carrying capacity and maximum dispersal distances. Model predictions were closest to the observed expansion of the grey squirrel and decline in the red squirrel when mortality was lower and fecundity higher than the averages recorded for the grey squirrel in the United Kingdom.},

@article{gillson_thresholds_2007,
	Abstract = {In the Kruger National Park ( KNP), South Africa, ecosystem managers use a series of monitoring endpoints, known as thresholds of potential concern ( TPCs), to define the upper and the lower levels of accepted variation in ecosystems. For woody vegetation, the current TPC suggests that woody cover should not drop by more than 80\% of its 'highest ever' value. In this paper, we explore the utility of palaeoecological data in informing TPCs. We use calibrated fossil pollen data to explore variability in vegetation at two sites over the past 5000 years, to provide a long-term record of changes in woody vegetation cover and a context for interpreting more recent vegetation change. The fossil pollen data are calibrated using studies of modern pollen and vegetation from KNP; arboreal pollen percentage was simulated using pollen - landscape modelling software for savannah landscapes of varying woody vegetation cover, and the relationship between vegetation and pollen data was quantified using nonlinear regression. This quadratic equation was then applied to fossil pollen data in order to estimate woody vegetation cover from arboreal pollen percentages. Our results suggest that the TPCs have not been exceeded during the period represented in the pollen record, because estimated woody vegetation cover has remained above 20\% of its highest ever value. By comparing the fossil pollen data with TPCs, our study demonstrates how palaeoecological data can be presented in a form that is directly relevant to management objectives.},

@article{turley_definition_2009,
	Abstract = {We present a method of multi-criteria assessment for the analysis of process model uncertainty that combines analysis of model structure, parameters and data requirements. There are three components in calculation and definition of uncertainty. (1) Assessment criteria: Uncertainty in a process model is reduced as the model can simultaneously simulate an increased number of assessment criteria selected to test specific aspects of the theory being investigated, and within acceptable limits set for those criteria. This reduces incomplete specification of the model-the characteristic that a model may explain some, but not all, of the observed features of a phenomenon. The calculation required is computation of the Pareto set which provides the list of simultaneously achieved criteria within specified ranges. (2) Parameter values: Uncertainty in a process model is reduced as the distribution of values for parameters simulating multiple assessment criteria within their acceptable limits becomes unimodal and with reduced range. This reduces non-uniqueness in the model-the characteristic that there may be alternative representations and no a priori way of deciding between them. The calculation required is analysis of parameter values within each group of the Pareto set, for their distributions and possible correlations which contributes to a definition of non-uniqueness in terms of whether multiple modes in parameter values are equally plausible. (3) Data and information: Uncertainty in a process model is reduced as the acceptable limits for assessment criteria are defined with increasing precision. The calculations required are to define acceptability ranges for the assessment criteria either through empirical investigations or through inference from related theories. This provides a definition of the relationship of the model to empirical and theoretical construction thought to be important. Three types of criteria should be used in assessment of uncertainty: (i) Tests of the quantitative domains of the model outputs. (ii) Examination of features explicitly predicted by the theory that the model describes. (iii) Tests between alternative structures in model formulation. The ability of a model to satisfy these criteria simultaneously is calculated using evolutionary computation and results are presented as a Pareto optimal set. Deficiencies in the model are revealed by manipulating acceptable limits around the assessment criteria, inclusion and exclusion of different criteria, and examining the distribution of model parameter values as non-dominated groups achieving different combinations of assessment criteria form in the Pareto optimal set. We illustrate this procedure through application to a simple model of competition between plants in single species even-aged populations. We use six assessment criteria and test an alternative to the model. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Forests are likely to show complex transient responses to rapid changes in climate. The model described here simulates the dynamics of forest landscapes in a changing environment with simple phenomenological equations for tree growth processes and local environmental feedbacks. Tree establishment and growth rates are modified by species-specific functions describing the effects of winter and summer temperature limitations, accumulated annual foliage net assimilation and sapwood respiration as functions of temperature, CO2 fertilization, and growing-season drought. These functions provide external conditions for the simulation of patch-scale forest dynamics by a forest succession model, FORSKA, in which all of the trees on each 0.1 ha patch interact by competition for light and nutrients. The landscape is simulated as an array of such patches. The probability of disturbance on a patch is a power function of time since disturbance. Forest structure, composition and biomass simulated for the landscape average in boreal and temperate deciduous forests approach reasonable equilibrium values in 200--400 years. A climatic warning scenario is applied to central Sweden, where temperature and precipitation increases are shown to interact with each other and with soil water capacity in determining the transient and equilibrium responses of the forest landscape to climate change.},

@article{magyar_importance_2007,
	Abstract = {Plants must cope with environmental variation in space and time. Phenotypic plasticity allows them to adjust their form and function to small-scale variations in habitat quality. Empirical studies have shown that stoloniferous plants can exploit heterogeneous habitats through plastic ramet specialization and internal resource exchange (division of labour). Here we present a spatially explicit simulation model to explore costs and benefits of plasticity in spatio-temporally heterogeneous environments. We investigated the performance of three plant strategies in pairwise competition. The nonplastic strategy was unable to specialize. The autonomous plastic strategy displayed localized responses to external resource signals. In the coordinated plastic strategy, localized responses could be modified by internal demand signals from connected modules. Plasticity in resource uptake proved beneficial in a broad range of environments. Modular coordination was beneficial under virtually all realistic conditions, especially if resource supplies did not closely match resource needs. The benefits of division of labour extend considerably beyond the parameter combination covered by empirical studies. Our model provides a general framework for evaluating the benefits, costs and limits of plasticity in spatio-temporally heterogeneous habitats.},

These changes are often difficult to reverse due to positive feedbacks that tend to stabilize the new situation. In this paper, we briefly review evidence for the idea that different states in these ecosystems might represent alternative equilibria and present a graphic model that summarizes the implications for their response to changing environmental conditions. We show how, in the light of this theoretical framework, climatic oscillations such as El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) could be used in combination with grazer control to restore degraded arid ecosystems. We also present evidence that, depending on grazing pressure, ENSO episodes can trigger structural and long-lasting changes in these ecosystems.},

	Abstract = {Variation of dead wood decay rates among tropical trees remains one source of uncertainty in global models of the carbon cycle. Taking advantage of a broad forest plot network surveyed for tree mortality over a 23-year period, we measured the remaining fraction of boles from 367 dead trees from 26 neotropical species widely varying in wood density (0.23-1.24 g cm(-3)) and tree circumference at death time (31.5-272.0 cm). We modeled decay rates within a Bayesian framework assuming a first order differential equation to model the decomposition process and tested for the effects of forest management (selective logging vs. unexploited), of mode of death (standing vs. downed) and of topographical levels (bottomlands vs. hillsides vs. hilltops) on wood decay rates. The general decay model predicts the observed remaining fraction of dead wood (R2 = 60\%) with only two biological predictors: tree circumference at death time and wood specific density. Neither selective logging nor local topography had a differential effect on wood decay rates. Including the mode of death into the model revealed that standing dead trees decomposed faster than downed dead trees, but the gain of model accuracy remains rather marginal. Overall, these results suggest that the release of carbon from tropical dead trees to the atmosphere can be simply estimated using tree circumference at death time and wood density.},

The more general concept of a continuation strategy is also discussed. It allows the analysis of various singularities of generic systems and of their mutual relationships. The approach is extended to codimension three singularities. We introduce several bifurcation functions and show how to use them to construct well-posed continuation problems. The described continuation technique is supported by an interactive graphical program called LOCBIF. We discuss briefly the concepts of the LOCBIF interface and give some examples of typical applications.},

	Abstract = {* Plant radiations are widespread but their influence on community assembly has rarely been investigated. Theory and some evidence suggest that radiations can allow lineages to monopolize niche space when founding species arrive early into new bioclimatic regions and exploit ecological opportunities. These early radiations may subsequently reduce niche availability and dampen diversification of later arrivals.


* We tested this hypothesis of time-dependent lineage diversification and community dominance using the alpine flora of New Zealand. We estimated ages of 16 genera from published phylogenies and determined their relative occurrence across climatic and physical gradients in the alpine zone. We used these data to reconstruct occupancy of environmental space through time, integrating palaeoclimatic and palaeogeological changes.


* Our analysis suggested that earlier-colonizing lineages encountered a greater availability of environmental space, which promoted greater species diversity and occupancy of niche space. Genera that occupied broader niches were subsequently more dominant in local communities. An earlier time of arrival also contributed to greater diversity independently of its influence in accessing niche space.


* We suggest that plant radiations influence community assembly when they arise early in the occupancy of environmental space, allowing them to exclude later-arriving colonists from ecological communities by niche preemption.},

	Abstract = {A global primary productivity and phytogeography model is described. The model represents the biochemical processes of photosynthesis and the dependence of gas exchange on stomatal conductance, which in turn depends on temperature and soil moisture. Canopy conductance controls soil water loss by evapotranspiration. The assignment of nitrogen uptake to leaf layers is proportional to irradiance, and respiration and maximum assimilation rates depend on nitrogen uptake and temperature. Total nitrogen uptake is derived from soil carbon and nitrogen and depends on temperature. The long-term average annual carbon and hydrological budgets dictate canopy leaf area. Although observations constrain soil carbon and nitrogen, the distribution of vegetation types is not specified by an underlying map. Variables simulated by the model are compared to experimental results. These comparisons extend from biochemical processes to the whole canopy, and the comparisons are favorable for both current and elevated CO2 atmospheres. The model is used to simulate the global distributions of leaf area index and annual net primary productivity. These distributions are sufficiently realistic to demonstrate that the model is useful for analyzing vegetation responses to global environmental change.},

@article{mercado_impact_2009,
	Abstract = {Plant photosynthesis tends to increase with irradiance. However, recent theoretical and observational studies have demonstrated that photosynthesis is also more efficient under diffuse light conditions(1-5). Changes in cloud cover or atmospheric aerosol loadings, arising from either volcanic or anthropogenic emissions, alter both the total photosynthetically active radiation reaching the surface and the fraction of this radiation that is diffuse, with uncertain overall effects on global plant productivity and the land carbon sink. Here we estimate the impact of variations in diffuse fraction on the land carbon sink using a global model modified to account for the effects of variations in both direct and diffuse radiation on canopy photosynthesis. We estimate that variations in diffuse fraction, associated largely with the 'global dimming' period(6-8), enhanced the land carbon sink by approximately one-quarter between 1960 and 1999. However, under a climate mitigation scenario for the twenty-first century in which sulphate aerosols decline before atmospheric CO2 is stabilized, this 'diffuse-radiation' fertilization effect declines rapidly to near zero by the end of the twenty-first century.},

@article{dumig_araucaria_2008,
	Abstract = {The vegetation of the southern Brazilian highlands in Rio Grande do Sul State is a mosaic of grassland (C4) and deciduous forests (C3) with the conifer Araucaria angustifolia. It was uncertain, whether the grasslands represent relics of drier periods in the Holocene or if they are the result of deforestation in recent times. We analyzed plant tissues from gramineous and woody species, organic surface layers, as well as soil organic matter of 13 Andosols and Umbrisols in grassland, shrubland, pine plantations and Araucaria forest for stable carbon isotope ratios (δ13C) and 14C activity. The soil organic matter was separated into a free particulate organic matter (fPOM) and a heavy, organo-mineral fraction by density fractionation. All grassland soils have consistently δ13C values of − 18.7 to − 14.3‰ typical for C4 grasses. In Araucaria forests and forest patches within grassland the δ13C values of both, the fPOM throughout the soil and the organic surface layers, are characteristic for the present below- and above-ground input from C3 trees. The C3- and C4-derived SOC stocks reflect expansion of Araucaria forest on grassland, which started after 1300 yr BP. The youngest forests are found at the forest border and in forest patches. Grassland soils lose their typically black colour from the top downwards after shrub encroachment or establishment of forest as indicated by increasing melanic indexes which are closely related to the δ13C values. The natural 13C depletion with depth in grassland soils counteracts the enrichment of 13C in the subsoils of present Araucaria forest. The results clearly indicate that current grasslands represent relics at least from the early and mid Holocene period (6000--8000 yr BP) and are not the result of recent deforestation.},

@article{robinson_implications_2007,
	Abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that significantly more plant carbon ( C) is stored belowground than existing estimates indicate. This study explores the implications for biome C pool sizes and global C fluxes. It predicts a root C pool of at least 268 Pg, 68\% larger than previously thought. Although still a low-precision estimate ( owing to the uncertainties of biome-scalemeasurements), a global root C pool this large implies stronger land C sinks, particularly in tropical and temperate forests, shrubland and savanna. The land sink predicted from revised C inventories is 2.7 Pg yr(-1). This is 0.1 Pg yr(-1) larger than current estimates, within the uncertainties associated with global C fluxes, but conflicting with a smaller sink ( 2.4 Pg yr(-1)) estimated from C balance. Sink estimates derived from C inventories and C balance match, however, if global soil C is assumed to be declining by 0.40.7\% yr(-1), rates that agree with long-term regional rates of soil C loss. Either possibility, a stronger land C sink or widespread soil C loss, argues that these features of the global C cycle should be reassessed to improve the accuracy and precision of C flux and pool estimates at both global and biome scales.},

The development of terrestrial biosphere models that predict the responses of ecosystems to climate and increasing CO2 levels has highlighted several mechanisms by which changes in ecosystem composition and function might alter regional and global climate. However, results from empirical studies suggest that ecosystem responses can differ markedly from the predictions of terrestrial biosphere models. As I discuss here, the challenge now is to connect terrestrial biosphere models to empirical ecosystem measurements. Only by systematically evaluating the predictions of terrestrial biosphere models against suites of ecosystem observations and experiments measurements will a true predictive science of the biosphere be achieved.},

@article{smallegange_distribution_2009,
	Abstract = {Game theoretical studies on contest behavior suggest that in foraging predators, interference through loss of foraging time is strongest between equal competitors. However, this phenomenon has not been incorporated into mechanistic models of interference. Instead, such models currently assume that individuals suffer most from dominant competitors, resulting in (semi)truncated, ideal free distributions (IFDs) of animals. Here, we develop a mechanistic interference model for 2 types of competitors: subordinates and dominants. The assumptions are that subordinates suffer interference through loss of foraging time from dominants but not vice versa. Time loss is greatest when 2 equal searchers interfere. A striking property of this 2-phenotype interference model is that dominants are most superior at intermediate values of the parameters prey density, handling time, and searching efficiency. This is because there the proportion of interfering subordinates relative to interfering dominants was highest. As the interference area for equal searchers increases, the difference in interference between dominants and subordinates diminishes. The IFD of the model is a mixed one with a larger share of dominants on the better patch but where the range of feeding rates exhibited by dominants and subordinates is the same for each patch. This contrasts with the (semi)truncated IFD predicted from other mechanistic interference models. We illustrate the generality of the model assumptions on interference and suggest that our modeling framework is applicable to many predator-prey systems.},

Tests against eddy covariance observations of carbon exchange by vegetation indicated significant difference between measured and simulated net ecosystem production (NEP). NEP is the net of large fluxes due to gross primary production and respiration, which are not directly measured and so there is some uncertainty in explaining a differences between observations and simulations. In addition it was noted that closer agreement of fluxes was, achieved for natural, or long-lived managed vegetation than for recently managed vegetation. The discrepancies appear to be Most closely related to respiratory carbon losses from the soil, but this area needs further exploration. The differences do not scale up to the global scale, where simulated and measured bal net biorne production were similar, indicating that fluxes measured at the managed observed sites are not typical globally. The model (the Sheffield Dynamic Global Vegetation Model, SDGVM) has been applied to contemporary vegetation dynamics and indicates a significant CO2 fertilisation effect on the sequestration of atmospheric CO2. The terrestrial carbon sink for the 20th century is simulated to be widespread between latitudes 40degreesS and 65degreesN, but is greatest between 10degrees S and 6degrees N, excluding the effects of human dellorestation. The mean maximum sink capacity over the 20th century is small, at 25 gC m(-2) year(-1) or approximately 1\% of gross primary production. Simulations of vegetation dynamics under a scenario of future global warming indicate a gradual decline in the terrestrial carbon sink, with the capacity to absorb human emissions of CO2 being reduced from 20\% in 2000 to approximately 2 \% between 2075 and 2100. The responses of carbon sequestration and vegetation structure and distribution to stabilisation of climate and CO2 may extend for up to 50 years after stabilisation has occurred.},

@article{crow_advantages_1994,
	Abstract = {Despite the obvious efficiencies of many forms of asexual reproduction, sexual reproduction abounds. Asexual species, for the most part, are relatively short-lived offshoots of sexual ancestors. From the nineteenth century, it has been recognized that, since there is no obvious advantage to the individuals involved, the advantages of sexual reproduction must be evolutionary. Furthermore, the advantage must be substantial; for example, producing males entails a two-fold cost, compared to dispensing with them and reproducing by parthenogenetic females. There are a large number of plausible hypotheses. To me the most convincing of these are two. The first hypothesis, and the oldest, is that sexual reproduction offers the opportunity to produce recombinant types that can make the population better able to keep up with changes in the environment. Although the subject of a great deal of work, and despite its great plausibility, the hypothesis has been very difficult to test by critical observations or experiments. Second, species with recombination can bunch harmful mutations together and eliminate several in a single ``genetic death.'' Asexual species, can eliminate them only in the same genotype in which they occurred. If the rate of occurrence of deleterious mutations is one or more per zygote, some mechanism for eliminating them efficiently must exist. A test of this mutation load hypothesis for sexual reproduction, then, is to find whether deleterious mutation rates in general are this high-as Drosophila data argue. Unfortunately, although molecular and evolutionary studies can give information on the total mutation rate, they cannot determine what fraction are deleterious. In addition, there are short discussions of the advantages of diploidy, anisogamy, and separate sexes. {\copyright} 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

However, a 100 years ago elephants were rare following excessive hunting. Simultaneously, ungulate populations were severely reduced by decease. The ecological effects of the reduction in large herbivores must have been substantial, but are little known. Today, however, ecosystem changes following the increase in elephant numbers cause considerable concern in Botswana. This was the background for the "BONIC" project, investigating the interactions between the increasing elephant population and other ecosystem components and processes. Results confirm that the ecosystem is changing following the increase in elephant and ungulate populations, and, presumably, developing towards a situation resembling that before the reduction of large herbivores. We see no ecological reasons to artificially change elephant numbers. There are, however, economic and social reasons to control elephants, and their range in northern Botswana may have to be artificially restricted.},

@article{kleidon_global_2000,
	Abstract = {We investigated the connection between plant species diversity and climate by using a process-based, generic plant model. Different 'species' were simulated by different values for certain growth-related model parameters. Subsequently, a wide range of values were tested in the framework of a 'Monte Carlo' simulation for success; that is, the capability of each plant with these parameter combinations to reproduce itself during its lifetime. The range of successful parameter combinations approximated species diversity. This method was applied to a global grid, using daily atmospheric forcing from a climate model simulation. The computed distribution of plant 'species' diversity compares very well with the observed, global-scale distribution of species diversity, reproducing the majority of 'hot spot' areas of biodiversity. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the predicted pattern is very robust against changes of fixed model parameters. Analysis of the climatic forcing and of two additional sensitivity simulations demonstrated that the crucial factor leading to this distribution of diversity is the early stage of a plant's life when water availability is highly coupled to the variability in precipitation because in this stage root-zone storage of water is small. We used cluster analysis in order to extract common sets of species parameters, mean plant properties and biogeographic regions (biomes) from the model output. The successful 'species' cannot be grouped into typical parameter combinations, which define the plant's functioning. However, the mean simulated plant properties, such as lifetime and growth, can be grouped into a few characteristic plant 'prototypes', ranging from short-lived, fast growing plants, similar to grasses, to long-lived, slow growing plants, similar to trees. The classification of regions with respect to similar combinations of successful 'species' yields a distribution of biomes similar to the observed distribution. Each biome has typical levels of climatic constraints, expressed for instance by the number of 'rainy days' and 'warm days'. The less the number of days favourable for growth, the greater the level of constraints and the less the 'species' diversity. These results suggest that climate as a fundamental constraint can explain much of the global scale, observed distribution of plant species diversity.},

@article{burt_perspective:_2000,
	Abstract = {Abstract.--- The idea that sex functions to provide variation for natural selection to act upon was first advocated by August Weismann and it has dominated much discussion on the evolution of sex and recombination since then. The goal of this paper is to further extend this hypothesis and to assess its place in a larger body of theory on the evolution of sex and recombination. A simple generic model is developed to show how fitness variation and covariation interact with selection for recombination and illustrate some important implications of the hypothesis: (1) the advantage of sex and recombination can accrue both to reproductively isolated populations and to modifiers segregating within populations, but the former will be much larger than the latter; (2) forces of degradation that are correlated across loci within an individual can reduce or reverse selection for increased recombination; and (3) crossing-over (which can occur at different places in different meioses) will create more variability than having multiple chromosomes and so will have more influence on the efficacy of selection. Several long-term selection experiments support Weismann's hypothesis, including those showing a greater response to selection in populations with higher rates of recombination and higher rates of recombination evolving as a correlated response to selection for some other character. Weismann's hypothesis is also consistent with the sporadic distribution of obligate asexuality, which indicates that clones have a higher rate of extinction than sexuals. Weismann's hypothesis is then discussed in light of other patterns in the distribution of sexuality versus asexuality. To account for variation in the frequency of obligate asexuality in different taxa, a simple model is developed in which this frequency is a function of three parameters: the rate of clonal origin, the initial fitness of clones when they arise, and the rate at which that fitness declines over time. Variation in all three parameters is likely to be important in explaining the distribution of obligate asexuality. Facultative asexuality also exists, and for this to be stable it seems there must be ecological differences between the sexual and asexual propagules as well as genetic differences. Finally, the timing of sex in cyclical parthenogens is most likely set to minimize the opportunity costs of sex. None of these patterns contradict Weismann's hypothesis, but they do show that many additional principles unrelated to the function of sex are required to fully explain its distribution. Weismann's hypothesis is also consistent with what we know about the mechanics and molecular genetics of recombination, in particular the tendency for chromatids to recombine with a homolog rather than a sister chromatid at meiosis, which is opposite to what they do during mitosis. However, molecular genetic studies have shown that cis-acting sites at which recombination is initiated are lost by gene conversion as a result, a factor that can be expected to affect many fine details in the evolution of recombination. In summary, although Weismann's hypothesis must be considered the leading candidate for the function of sex and recombination, nevertheless, many additional principles are needed to fully account for their evolution.},

	Abstract = {A spatially explicit 3-D model of crown geometry is combined with a radiative transfer model for heterogeneous media to predict the transmittance of a discontinuous Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.) canopy under different architectural assumptions. The canopy gap fraction was sampled with a Plant Canopy Analyser (PCA; LAI 2000, LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) at 200 regularly spaced points in the understorey. A comparison of predicted and observed values of diffuse non-interceptance (DIFN) shows I:hat the above model can predict most of the spatial variability of the diffuse fluxes (R-2 = 0.97). In order to evaluate the variation in light penetration due to needle clumping in shoots, two architectural hypotheses are tested: random distribution of needles (scenario 1) and of shoots (scenario 2) within crowns. Results indicate that the variability in the radiative fluxes clue to shoot architecture is rather limited in comparison with the variability generated by canopy discontinuities. However, assuming shoots as the basic foliage element slightly improves the model performance. The predictive accuracy for the two architectural hypotheses is similar, with a mean absolute percent error of 12.2 and 12.0\% for scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. The predictive bias is almost equivalent in magnitude but opposite in sign (mean percent error of -4.82 and 3.55\%, for scenarios 1 and 2, respectively). The underestimation of the DIFN in the first scenario suggests that, when needles are considered as basic foliage elements, the spatial distribution is not random, bur clumped. On the contrary, the overestimation of DIFN in scenario 2 indicates that the spatial distribution of shoots is more regular than random. The angular distribution of the predictive error in the bands of the PCA suggests that the angular distribution of the shoot normal was more ellipsoidal than the spherical one adopted in the simulation, while leaf clumping in whorls appears to be the source of the high gap fraction at larger zenith angles.

	Abstract = {Traditionally, the dynamics of community assembly has been analyzed by means of deterministic models of differential equations. Despite the theoretical advances provided by such models, they are restricted to questions about community-wide features. The individual-based modeling offers an opportunity to link bionomic features to patterns at the community scale, allowing us to understand how trait-based assembly rules can arise by dynamical processes. The present paper introduces an individual-based model of community assembly, and discusses some of the major advantages and drawbacks of this approach. The model was framed to deal with predation among size-structured populations, incorporating allometric constraints to energetic requirements, movement, life-history features and interaction relationships among individuals. A protocol of assembly procedure is proposed, in which a period of intense species introductions is followed by a period without introductions. The resultant communities did not present any pattern of trait over-dispersion, meaning that the multivariate distances of bionomic features among co-occurring species were neither larger nor more regular than expected in a random collection of species. It suggests a weak influence of interspecific interactions in the model environment and individualistic rules of coexistence, driven mainly by the spatial structure. This highlights that trait over-dispersion and resource partitioning should not be considered a necessary condition for coexistence, even in communities entirely structured by internal processes like predation and competition.

@article{young_elephant_2009,
	Abstract = {The influence of elephants on woody vegetation cover varies from place to place. In part this may be due to the way elephants utilize space across landscapes and within their home ranges in response to the availability and distribution of food. We used location data from 18 cows at six study sites across an east to west rainfall gradient in southern Africa to test whether wet- and dry-season home-range sizes, evenness of space use within seasonal home ranges and range overlap between seasons and between years, differed between wet and dry savannas. We then tested whether the quantity, distribution and seasonal stability in vegetation productivity, a coarse measure of food for elephants, explained differences. Elephants in wet savannas had smaller wet- and dry-season home ranges and also returned to a higher proportion of previously visited grid cells between seasons and between years than elephants living in dry savannas. Wet-season home-range sizes were explained by seasonal vegetation productivity while dry-season home-range sizes were explained by heterogeneity in the distribution of vegetation productivity. The influence of the latter on dry-season home ranges differed among structural vegetation classes. Range overlap between seasons and between years was related to inter-seasonal and inter-annual stability in vegetation productivity, respectively. Evenness of elephant spatial use within home ranges did not differ between savanna types, but it was explained by seasonal vegetation productivity and heterogeneity in the distribution of vegetation productivity during the wet season. Differences in elephant spatial use patterns between wet and dry savannas according to vegetation structure and season may need to be included in the development of site-specific objectives and management approaches for African elephants.},

	Abstract = {Environmentally induced variation in survival and fecundity generates demographic fluctuations that affect population growth rate. However, a general pattern of the comparative influence of variation in fecundity and juvenile survival on elephant population dynamics has not been investigated at a broad scale. We evaluated the relative importance of conception, gestation, first year survival and subsequent survivorship for controlling demographic variation by exploring the relationship between past environmental conditions determined by integrated normalized difference vegetation index (INDVI) and the shape of age distributions at 17 sites across Africa. We showed that, generally, INDVI during gestation best explained anomalies in age structure. However, in areas with low mean annual rainfall, INDVI during the first year of life was critical. The results challenge Eberhardt's paradigm for population analysis that suggests that populations respond to limited resource availability through a sequential decrease in juvenile survival, reproductive rate and adult survival. Contrastingly, elephants appear to respond first through a reduction in reproductive rate. We conclude that this discrepancy is likely due to the evolutionary significance of extremely large body size - an adaptation that increases survival rate but decreases reproductive potential. Other megaherbivores may respond similarly to resource limitation due to similarities in population dynamics. Knowing how vital rates vary with changing environmental conditions will permit better forecasts of the trajectories of megaherbivore populations.},

	Abstract = {Evidence suggests that C-4 grasses, adapted to conditions of low CO,, high temperatures, and water-stressed environments, expanded relatively quickly, and in several geographically distinct regions, during the Late Miocene (approximately 9-7 Ma). Using a variety of modelling tools, we attempt to explain this expansion in terms of changes in global climate. We use a fully coupled atmosphere-ocean General Circulation Model (AOGCM, HadCM3L) to simulate global climate before and after the expansion (the Late Oligocene, 27 Ma, and pre-industrial). We then use the simulated climates to drive a process-based global vegetation model (LPJ). Contrary to indications from palaeo data, the vegetation model predicts a greater C4 distribution during the Late Oligocene than the pre-industrial. The principal reason for this is that the relatively high tropical temperatures which we predict for the Late Oligocene confer a competitive advantage on C4 grasses over C-3 grasses which outweighs the disadvantage imposed by the higher CO2 concentrations. We find that this result is robust to prescription of different CO, levels in the Late Oligocene AOGCM simulation, and to the vegetation model used. Of the several possible explanations proposed for the modeldata discrepancy, three seem most likely. First, that the vegetation models do not adequately represent certain processes under extreme climate conditions, such as fire disturbance, or key parameters related to the competition between C-3 and C-4 grasses. Second, that there existed an evolutionary niche for C-4 grasses prior to their expansion in the Late Miocene, which for some reason was not filled. Third, that we have not adequately modelled the Late Oligocene climate with the AOGCM. Future research should concentrate on the collection and analysis of additional data for the assessment of palaeo tropical land temperatures, and on further testing of the sensitivity of the AOGCM results.

Our study was aimed at (1) quantifying the changes in gross rates of microbial N cycling under ambient and reduced N conditions, and (2) relating the soil N dynamics to the changes in N leaching and N status of trees. Two roofs were used, one to achieve "ambient" and the other reduced ("clean rain") inputs, with a roofless plot as a control for possible roof effects. In 2001, the ambient roof and ambient no-roof plots showed an apparent decrease in gross N mineralization rates and significantly lower microbial NH4+ immobilization rates and turnover rates of NH4+ and microbial N pools. The microbial NO3- immobilization rates and NO3- pool turnover rates were lower than the microbial NH4+ immobilization rates and NH4+ pool turnover rates, showing that less NO,cycled through microorganisms than NH4+. There was also low abiotic NO3- immobilization. High NO3- input from throughfall and low microbial turnover rates of the NO3- Pool, combined with low abiotic NO3- retention, may have contributed to the high NO3- leaching losses in these ambient plots. The clean rain plot showed a slight increase in gross N mineralization rates and significantly higher microbial NH4+ immobilization rates and turnover rates of NH4+ and microbial N pools. Neither nitrification nor soil NO3- was detectable. There was an increase in abiotic NO3- immobilization. Foliar N concentration had decreased but was still adequate. An efficient cycling of NH4+ through microorganisms, combined with the high abiotic NO3- immobilization, indicated efficient mineral N retention in the clean rain plot. These results indicated that long-term reduction of throughfall N and acid inputs had induced high but tightly coupled microbial NH4+ cycling and an increase in abiotic NO3- retention, which contributed to the reversal of N saturation.},

	Abstract = {Litterbag experiments provide valuable data for testing the accuracy of predictions of decomposition from soil carbon models. The soil carbon model Yasso describes litter decomposition based on basic climate and litter quality information, and was calibrated using European litterbag data. In this study, we tested the predictive capabilities of Yasso using independent litterbag data for 10 foliage litter types decomposed for 6 years at 18 upland forest sites across Canada (CIDET). The model underestimated mass of leaf litters remaining on CIDET sites, with only a small systematic error in predicting the effects of climate when effective temperature sum was used as the temperature variable in the model. The overall rate of decomposition was predicted correctly when mean annual temperature was used as the temperature variable, but then the model substantially overestimated climatic effects. The model correctly predicted differences in decomposition rates among litter types in the early years of decomposition, but underestimated them in later years. The decomposition rate of the litter type richest in phenolic compounds (larch needles) was systematically overestimated, and that of the litter type richest in O-alkyl compounds (grass leaves) was systematically underestimated. Accounting for these factors would improve the general applicability of the model. However, accounting for the initial nitrogen concentration of litter did not improve the accuracy of the model unless the initial lignin (i.e., acid unhydrolyzable residue) content was also taken into account. We conclude that the model Yasso accounts for most of the effects of climate and initial litter quality on the decomposition of a range of foliage litter types under varying climate conditions. Recalibration of the reference decomposition rates used in the model may improve the accuracy when applying the model outside of Europe. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{hely_sensitivity_2006,
	Abstract = {Aim Africa is identified by the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as the least studied continent in terms of ecosystem dynamics and climate variability. The aim of this study was (1) to adapt the Lund-Postdam-Jena-GUESS (LPJ-GUESS) ecological modelling framework to Africa by providing new parameter values for tropical plant functional types (PFT), and (2) to assess the sensitivity of some African biomes to changes in precipitation regime.Location The study area was a representative transect (0--22$\,^{\circ}$ N and 7--18$\,^{\circ}$ E) through the transition from equatorial evergreen forests to savannas, steppes and desert northwards. The transect showed large latitudinal variation in precipitation (mean rainfall ranged from 50 to 2300 mm year−1).Methods New PFT parameters used to calibrate LPJ-GUESS were based on modern pollen PFTs and remote sensed leaf area index (LAI). The model was validated using independent modern pollen assemblages, LAI and through comparison with White's modern potential vegetation map. Several scenarios were developed by combining changes in total rainfall amount with variation in the length of the dry season in order to test the sensitivity of African biomes.Results Simulated vegetation compared well to observed data at local and regional scales, in terms of ecosystem functioning (LAI), and composition (pollen and White's vegetation map). The assessment of the sensitivity of biomes to changes in precipitation showed that none of the ecosystems would shift towards a new type under the range of precipitation increases suggested by the IPCC (increases from 5 to 20\%). However, deciduous and semi-deciduous forests may be very sensitive to small reductions in both the amount and seasonality of precipitation.Main conclusions This version of LPJ-GUESS parameterized for Africa simulated correctly the vegetation present over a wide precipitation gradient. The biome sensitivity assessment showed that, compared with savannas and grasslands, closed canopy forests may be more sensitive to change in precipitation regime due to the synergetic effects of changed rainfall amounts and seasonality on vegetation functioning.},

@article{gerten_terrestrial_2004,
	Abstract = {Earth's vegetation plays a pivotal role in the global water balance. Hence, there is a need to model dynamic interactions and feedbacks between the terrestrial biosphere and the water cycle. Here, the hydrological performance of the Lund--Potsdam--Jena model (LPJ), a prominent dynamic global vegetation model, is evaluated. Models of this type simulate the coupled terrestrial carbon and water cycle, thus they are well suited for investigating biosphere--hydrosphere interactions over large domains. We demonstrate that runoff and evapotranspiration computed by LPJ agree well with respective results from state-of-the-art global hydrological models, while in some regions, runoff is significantly over- or underestimated compared to observations. The direction and magnitude of these biases is largely similar to those from other macro-scale models, rather than specific to LPJ. They are attributable primarily to uncertainties in the climate input data, and to human interventions not considered by the model (e.g. water withdrawal, land cover conversions). Additional model development is required to perform integrated assessments of water exchanges among the biosphere, the hydrosphere, and the anthroposphere. Yet, the LPJ model can now be used to study inter-relations between the world's major vegetation types and the terrestrial water balance. As an example, it is shown that a doubling of atmospheric CO2 content alone would result in pronounced changes in evapotranspiration and runoff for many parts of the world. Although significant, these changes would remain unseen by stand-alone hydrological models, thereby emphasizing the importance of simulating the coupled carbon and water cycle.},

@article{holmgren_effects_2013,
	Abstract = {Climatic warming is substantially intensifying the global water cycle and is projected to increase rainfall variability. Using satellite data, we show that higher climatic variability is associated with reduced tree cover in the wet tropics globally. In contrast, interannual variability in rainfall can have neutral or even positive effects on tree cover in the dry tropics. In South America, tree cover in dry lands is higher in areas with high year-to-year variability in rainfall. This is consistent with evidence from case studies suggesting that in these areas rare wet episodes are essential for opening windows of opportunity where massive tree recruitment can overwhelm disturbance effects, allowing the establishment of extensive woodlands. In Australia, wet extremes have similar effects, but the net effect of rainfall variability is overwhelmed by negative effects of extreme dry years. In Africa, effects of rainfall variability are neutral for dry lands. It is most likely that differences in herbivore communities and fire regimes contribute to regulating tree expansion during wet extremes. Our results illustrate that increasing climatic variability may affect ecosystem services in contrasting, and sometimes surprising, ways. Expansion of dry tropical tree cover during extreme wet events may decrease grassland productivity but enhance carbon sequestration, soil nutrient retention and biodiversity.},

	Abstract = {The upheaval of the northern Andes in Miocene and Pliocene time changed the drainage system in northern South America significantly and caused the present-day rain forest areas of Choc{\'o} and the Lower Magdalena Valley became separated from Amazonas. Plant diversity may have reached the highest level in the Miocene or Pliocene, and excessive present-day phytodiversity may be regarded as a legacy of the Tertiary, rather than an evolutionary product of the Quaternary. In the Quaternary strong temperature oscillations, related to the series of ice-ages, were superposed on the Late Tertiary forest dynamics, which included river displacement and latitudinal migrations of the equatorial rain belt (caloric equator) with the rhythm of the precession cycle of orbital climate forcing. The hypothesis that claims a permanent rain forest cover all over the Amazon basin during the last glacial is in contrast with the `forest refugia hypothesis', which accepts replacement of rain forest by savanna, or savanna forest, during dry climatic intervals. Both scenarios have been evidenced by pollen records. In this paper, it is suggested that both hypotheses are not necessarily conflicting and apparently did occur in different parts of the Amazon basin, and in different periods, depending on the climatological constraints. A compilation of the most important literature concerning the vegetational, climatic, and environmental history of the rain forest areas of Amazonas and Choc{\'o}, and surrounding dry ecosystems has been included.},

Pots were watered to field capacity and then dehydrated for 3 to 9 weeks to reach various visual wilting stages, from slightly wilted to dead. Saturated root hydraulic conductance was measured with a high-pressure flowmeter, and whole-stem hydraulic conductance was measured by a vacuum chamber method. Leaf punches (5.6-mm diameter) were harvested for measurement of leaf water potential by a thermocouple psychrometer method and for measurement of fresh and dry weight. In a parallel study, the same five species were studied in a field experiment in the understory of a tropical forest, where these species frequently germinate. Control seedlings were maintained in irrigated plots during a dry season, and experimental plants were grown in similar plots with rain exclusion shelters. Every 2 to 4 weeks, the seedlings were scored for wilt state and survivorship. After a 22-week drought, the dry plots were irrigated for several weeks to verify visual symptoms of death. The field trials were used to rank drought performance of species, and the greenhouse desiccation studies were used to determine the conditions of moribund plants. Our conclusion is that the desiccation tolerance of moribund plants correlated with field assessment of drought-performance for the five species (r(2) {\textgreater} 0.94).},

	Abstract = {An individual-based Dynamic Global Vegetation Model, the SEIB-DCVM, was adapted to a Malaysian tropical rain forest by incorporating formulas and parameters from a gap dynamics model, FORMIX3. After calibration, the model reconstructed forest structure (i.e., size structure, leaf area index, and woody biomass) and carbon fluxes (i.e., gross and net primary productivity) of a dipterocarp forest in Pasoh, Peninsular Malaysia. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the model was robust; forest structure and ecosystem functions moderately fluctuated due to changes in parameters and climatic environments. Sensitivity analysis also indicated that the success and decay of a dominant species group that monopolized the canopy layer greatly affected those of a less abundant, shade-intolerant group. This result indicates that even if environmental changes do not exhibit clear effects on dominant canopy species and/or whole forest structure, such changes may still substantially impact the biodiversity of subdominant species. In simulations without gap formation, woody biomass was overestimated and a shade-intolerant species group was eliminated. This finding indicates that incorporating gap formation into the individual-based model is essential for the appropriate simulation of forest biomass and biodiversity in this Malaysian tropical rain forest.

	Abstract = {Abstract  Previous experimental studies of competition among foragers rarely distinguished between exploitation and interference competition.
In many systems this separation is experimentally impossible without interfering with the natural behavior of the animals.
Consequently, these studies can only demonstrate the combined effect of interference and exploitation on the forager's feeding
rate, namely, it usually decreases in a decelerating rate as a function of density. We suggest here a simple experimental
and statistical procedure that facilitates the separation of the effects of interference from those of exploitation. This
procedure includes manipulation of both predator density and the foraging experiment duration. The statistical analysis is
based on multiple linear regression. The working assumption is that exploitation can be neglected at the beginning of the
foraging experiment because, initially, predators do not experience diminishing returns in prey capture rates. Using both
the results of an individual-based simulation and a field experiment dataset of gerbils foraging for seeds in an artificial
food patch located in the field, we demonstrate that our procedure can successfully detect and separate the effect of interference
from the combined overall effect of competition (i.e., interference plus exploitation).},

	Abstract = {The considerable complexity often included in biophysical models leads to the need of specifying a large number of parameters and inputs, which are available with various levels of uncertainty. Also, models may behave counter-intuitively, particularly when there are nonlinearities in multiple input-output relationships. Quantitative knowledge of the sensitivity of models to changes in their parameters is hence a prerequisite for operational use of models. This can be achieved using sensitivity analysis (SA) via methods which differ for specific characteristics, including computational resources required to perform the analysis. Running SA on biophysical models across several contexts requires flexible and computationally efficient SA approaches, which must be able to account also for possible interactions among parameters. A number of SA experiments were performed on a crop model for the simulation of rice growth (Water Accounting Rice Model, WARM) in Northern Italy. SAs were carried out using the Morris method, three regression-based methods (Latin hypercube sampling, random and Quasi-Random, LpTau), and two methods based on variance decomposition: Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (E-FAST) and Sobol', with the latter adopted as benchmark. Aboveground biomass at physiological maturity was selected as reference output to facilitate the comparison of alternative SA methods. Rankings of crop parameters (from the most to the least relevant) were generated according to sensitivity experiments using different SA methods and alternate parameterizations for each method, and calculating the top-down coefficient of concordance (TDCC) as measure of agreement between rankings. With few exceptions, significant TDCC values were obtained both for different parameterizations within each method and for the comparison of each method to the Sobol' one. The substantial stability observed in the rankings seem to indicate that, for a crop model of average complexity such as WARM, resource intensive SA methods could not be needed to identify most relevant parameters. In fact, the simplest among the SA methods used (i.e., Morris method) produced results comparable to those obtained by methods more computationally expensive. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {Patterns in the dominance of evergreen vs. deciduous plants have long interested ecologists, biogeographers, and global modellers. But previous models to account for these patterns have significant weaknesses. Bottom-up, mechanistic modelsbased on physiology, competition, and natural selectionhave often been non-quantitative or restricted to a small range of habitats, and almost all have ignored belowground costs and whole-plant integration. Top-down, ecosystem-based models have succeeded in quantitatively reproducing several patterns, but rely partly on empirically derived constants and thresholds that lack a mechanistic explanation. It is generally recognized that seasonal drought can favor deciduous leaves, and that infertile soils can favor long-lived evergreen leaves. But no model has yet explained three great paradoxes, involving dominance by 1) evergreens in highly seasonal, boreal forests, 2) deciduous larch in many nutrient-poor peatlands, and 3) evergreen leaf-exchangers in nutrient-poor subtropical forests, even though they shed their leaves just as frequently as deciduous species. This paper outlines a generalized optimality model to account for these and other patterns in leaf longevity and phenology, based on maximizing whole-plant carbon gain or height growth, and building on recent advances in our understanding of the quantitative relationships of leaf photosynthesis, nitrogen content, and mass per unit area to leaf life-span. Only a whole-plant approach can explain evergreen dominance under realistic ecological conditions, or account for the boreal paradox, the larch paradox, the leaf-exchanger paradox, and expected shifts in shade tolerance associated with leaf phenology. Poor soils favor evergreens not merely by increasing the costs of nutrient acquisition, but also by depressing the maximum rate of photosynthesis and thus the seasonal contrast in photosynthetic return between leaves adapted to favorable vs. unfavorable conditions. The dominance of evergreens in western North America beyond the coastal zone of mild winters and winter rainfall appears related to the unusually long photosynthetic season for evergreen vs. deciduous plants there. Future models for optimal leaf phenology must incorporate differences between evergreen and deciduous plants in allocation to photosynthetic vs. non-photosynthetic tissue, rooting depth, stem allometry, xylem anatomy, and exposure to herbivores and leaching, and analyze how these differences interact with the photosynthetic rate, transpiration, and nutrient demands of leaves with different life-spans to affect rates of height growth in specific microsites.},

	Abstract = {Drought stress plays an important role in determining both the structure and function of forest ecosystems, because of the close association between the carbon (C) and hydrological cycles. We used a detailed model of the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum to investigate the links between carbon uptake and the hydrological cycle in a mature, open stand of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) at the Metolius river in eastern Oregon over a 2-year period (1996-1997). The model was parameterized from local measurements of vegetation structure, soil properties and meteorology, and tested against independent measurements of ecosystem latent energy (LE) and carbon fluxes and soil water content. Although the 2 years had very different precipitation regimes, annual uptake of C and total transpiration were similar in both years, according to both direct observation and simulations. There were important differences in ratios of evaporation to transpiration, and in the patterns of water abstraction from the soil profile, depending on the frequency of summer storms. Simulations showed that, during periods of maximum water limitation in late summer, plants maintained a remarkably constant evapotranspirative flux because of deep rooting, whereas changes in rates of C accumulation were determined by interactions between atmospheric vapor pressure deficit and stomatal conductance. Sensitivity analyses with the model suggest a highly conservative allocation strategy in the vegetation, focused belowground on accessing a soil volume large enough to buffer summer droughts, and optimized to account for interannual variability in precipitation. The model suggests that increased allocation to leaf area would greatly increase productivity, but with the associated risk of greater soil water depletion and drought stress in some years. By constructing sparse canopies and deep rooting systems, these stands balance reduced productivity in the short term with risk avoidance over the long term.},

	Abstract = {Analysis of daily variability of temperature in climate model experiments is important as a model diagnostic and for determination of how such variability may change under perturbed climate conditions. The latter could be important from a climate impacts perspective. We analyze daily mean, diurnal range and variability of surface air temperature in two continuous 3 1/2 year long climate simulations over the continental USA, one for present day conditions and one for conditions under doubled carbon dioxide concentration, conducted with a regional climate model (RegCM), on a 60 km grid, nested in a general circulation model (GCM). Model output is compared with a 30-year daily observational data set for various regions of the USA. In comparison with observations the diurnal range in the model control run is somewhat too low although the daily temperature mean is often well reproduced. The daily variability of temperature is underestimated by the model in all areas, but particularly when and where the observed variability is relatively high. Causes for these underestimations are traced to deficiencies in the general circulation of the driving GCM. With: doubled CO2, both maximum and minimum temperatures increase, but the change in the diurnal temperature range (DTR) varies spatially and seasonally. On an annual average over the land domain, the DTR decreases by 0.25 degrees C. Changes in DTR are most strongly correlated with changes in absorbed shortwave radiation at the surface, which explains 72\% of the variance in DTR on an annual basis. Change in evaporation was factor affecting DTR only in the summer when it explained 52\% of the variance. The most significant findings with CO2 doubling are substantial decreases in daily variability in winter over large portions of the domain, and localized increases in summer. Causes for these changes are traced to fluctuations in the intensity and position of the jet stream.},

	Abstract = {Wood represents the defining feature of forest systems, and often the carbon in woody debris has a long residence time. Globally, coarse dead wood contains 36-72 Pg C, and understanding what controls the fate of this C is important for predicting C cycle responses to global change. The fate of a piece of wood may include one or more of the following: microbial decomposition, combustion, consumption by insects, and physical degradation. The probability of each fate is a function of both the abiotic environment and the wood traits of the species. The wood produced by different species varies substantially in chemical, micro- and macro-morphological traits; many of these characteristics of living species have 'afterlife' effects on the fate and turnover rate of dead wood. The colonization of dead wood by microbes and their activity depends on a large suite of wood chemical and anatomical traits, as well as whole-plant traits such as stem-diameter distributions. Fire consumption is driven by a slightly narrower range of traits with little dependence on wood anatomy. Wood turnover due to insects mainly depends on wood density and secondary chemistry. Physical degradation is a relatively minor loss pathway for most systems, which depends on wood chemistry and environmental conditions. We conclude that information about the traits of woody plants could be extremely useful for modeling and predicting rates of wood turnover across ecosystems. We demonstrate how this trait-based approach is currently limited by oversimplified treatment of dead wood pools in several leading global C models and by a lack of quantitative empirical data linking woody plant traits with the probability and rate of each turnover pathway. Explicitly including plant traits and woody debris pools in global vegetation climate models would improve predictions of wood turnover and its feedback to climate.},

There was excellent agreement for both the magnitude and timing in the annual variation in LAI from MC5 and biometric estimates at Howard Springs, near Darwin, whereas MC4 overestimated LAI by 1-2 m(2) m(-2) for the first 200 days of the year. Estimates of LAI from MC5 were also compared with those obtained from the analysis of digital hemispherical photographs taken during the dry season (September 2008) based on algorithms that included random and clumped distribution of leaves. Linear regression of LAI from MC5 versus that using the clumping algorithm yielded a slope close to 1 (m = 0.98). The regression based on a random distribution of leaves yielded a slope significantly different from 1 (m = 1.37), with higher Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and bias compared to the clumped analysis. The intercept for either analysis was not significantly different from zero but inclusion of five additional sites that were visually bare or without green vegetation produced a statistically significant offset of +0.16 m(2) m(-2) by MC5. Overall, our results show considerable improvement of MC5 over MC4 LAI and good agreement between MC5 and ground-based LAI estimates from hemispherical photos incorporating clumping of leaves.

@article{goss-custard_deriving_1995,
	Abstract = {1. The basic structure is described of a game theory model of the distribution of a wintering shorebird, the oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus, foraging on 12 mussel Mytilus edulis beds whose quality as feeding areas for the birds differed. Model parameters were derived from field studies made over 15 years. A companion paper tests model predictions and illustrates how the model can be used to derive survival curves and predict estuary carrying capacity. 2. Mussel-bed quality was measured as the intake rate achieved by an oystercatcher of average competance foraging at random over the bed, and varied threefold across beds. Each individual in the model was given its own foraging efficiency, drawn at random from a normal distribution whose mean and variance depended on the bird's age and feeding method. Its susceptibility to interference from other foraging birds was calculated from its local dominance score, the percentage of wins it had over the other individuals currently on the same bed. A bird's local dominance score on a particular mussel bed was calculated from the proportion of birds on that bed having a lower global dominance rank, a measure of a bird's competitive ability relative to those of all other birds on the estuary. Across individuals, foraging efficiency and susceptibility to interference were unrelated. 3. In every iteration, the model calculated a bird's putative intake rate on each bed by subtracting the reduction in intake rate due to interference from the intake rate the bird could achieve there in the absence of interference. Each individual could then move to the mussel bed which, at that time, gave it the highest intake rate, provided the differences were sufficiently large (3\%) for it to discriminate. 4. The main model limitations were the absence of: (i) a real-time base, so time-lags due to learning were not included; (ii) the energy costs associated with moving between beds; (iii) the opportunity for birds to increase their dominance score or foraging efficiency through familiarity with a mussel bed; (iv) the opportunity for individuals to control the amount of competition to which they are exposed by selecting particular times in the tidal cycle at which to feed; and (v) factors known to affect bed attractiveness to oystercatchers, such as the consistency of the substrate. None the less, the model was regarded as a suitable starting point for exploring how the proportion failing to acquire enough food, and either emigrating or starving, is affected by population size.},

@article{foley_regime_2003,
	Abstract = {The Sahara and Sahel regions of northern Africa have complex environmental histories punctuated by sudden and dramatic "regime shifts" in climate and ecological conditions. Here we review the current understanding of the causes and consequences of two environmental regime shifts in the Sahara and Sahel. The first regime shift is the sudden transition from vegetated to desert conditions in the Sahara about 5500 years ago. Geologic data show that wet environmental conditions in this region-giving rise to extensive vegetation, lakes, and wet-lands-came to an abrupt end about 5500 years ago. Explanations for climatic changes in northern Africa during the Holocene have suggested that millennial-scale changes in the Earth's orbit could have caused the wet conditions that prevailed in the early Holocene and the dry conditions prevalent today. However, the orbital hypothesis, by itself, does not explain the sudden regime shift 5500 years ago. Several modeling studies have proposed that strong, nonlinear feedbacks between vegetation and the atmosphere could amplify the effects of orbital variations and create two alternative stable states (or "regimes") in the climate and ecosystems of the Sahara: a "green Sahara" and a "desert Sahara." A recent coupled atmosphere-ocean-land model confirmed that there was a sudden shift from the "green Sahara" to the "desert Sahara" regime approximately 5500 years ago. The second regime shift is the onset of a major 30-year drought over the Sahel around 1969. Several lines of evidence have suggested that the interactions between atmosphere and vegetation act to reinforce either a "wet Sahel" or a "dry Sahel" climatic regime, which may persist for decades at a time. Recent modeling studies have indicated that the shift from a "wet Sahel" to a "dry Sahel" regime was caused by strong feedbacks between the climate and vegetation cover and may have been triggered by slow changes in either land degradation or sea-surface temperatures. Taken together, we conclude that the existence of alternative stable states (or regimes) in the climate and ecosystems of the Sahara and Sahel may be the result of strong, nonlinear interactions between vegetation and the atmosphere. Although the shifts between these regimes occur rapidly, they are made possible by slow, subtle changes in underlying environmental conditions, including slow changes in incoming solar radiation, sea-surface temperatures, or the degree of land degradation.},

	Abstract = {An understanding of how environmental stresses contribute to tree mortality is essential for predicting the impact of these stresses on forests. Utilizing a qualitative, mechanistic model of tree resource acquisition and allocation, I evaluated a conceptual model of the process of tree mortality. The conceptual mortality process model posits that tree mortality may result from short-term environmental stresses (e.g. drought or insect defoliation) acting on trees that have been predisposed to injury by long-term environmental stresses (e.g. air pollution or competition). A previous held study identified oaks that died in a manner consistent with this conceptual model and the mechanistic model provides further support for the conceptual model. When subjected to simulated short-and long-term stresses, the mechanistic model predicts changes in tree vigor that are similar to the changes in vigor predicted by the conceptual mortality process model. The simulation results also suggest a mechanism by which short-term environmental stresses affect tree physiology prior to death. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

This makes analysis tractable, and has led to the conclusion that segregation of species in space does not promote coexistence. However, these symmetries leave parts of the parameter space uninvestigated. Using a moment-approximation method, we present a spatial version of the Lotka-Volterra competition equations to investigate effects of removing symmetries in the distances over which individuals disperse and interact. Some spatial segregation of the species always comes about due to competition, and such segregation does not necessarily lead to coexistence. But, if interspecific competition occurs over shorter distances than intraspecific competition (heteromyopia), spatial segregation becomes strong enough to promote coexistence. Such coexistence is most likely when the species have similar dynamics, in contrast to the competition-colonization trade-off that requires large competitive differences between species.},

As might be expected, we show that the latter system generates a classic devil's staircase and Arnold tongues, similar to that found from a qualitative analysis of the circle map. The circle map has other subtle features that make it useful for explaining the two qualitatively distinct forms of chaos recently noted in numerical studies of the forced Lotka-Volterra system. In the regions of overlapping tongues, coexisting attractors may be found in the Lotka-Volterra system, including at least one example of three alternative attractors, the separatrices of which are fractal and, in one specific case, Wada. The analysis is extended to a periodically forced tritrophic foodweb model that is chaotic, interestingly, mode-locking Arnold tongue structures are observed in the model's phase dynamics even though the foodweb equations are chaotic.

	Abstract = {We assess the role of changing natural (volcanic, aerosol, insolation) and anthropogenic (CO2 emissions, land cover) forcings on the global climate system over the last 150 years using an earth system model of intermediate complexity, CLIMBER-2. We apply several datasets of historical land-use reconstructions: the cropland dataset by Ramankutty \& Foley (1999) (R\&F), the HYDE land cover dataset of Klein Goldewijk (2001), and the land-use emissions data from Houghton \& Hackler (2002). Comparison between the simulated and observed temporal evolution of atmospheric CO2 and delta(13)CO(2) are used to evaluate these datasets. To check model uncertainty, CLIMBER-2 was coupled to the more complex Lund-Potsdam-Jena (LPJ) dynamic global vegetation model. In simulation with R\&F dataset, biogeophysical mechanisms due to land cover changes tend to decrease global air temperature by 0.26degreesC, while biogeochemical mechanisms act to warm the climate by 0.18degreesC. The net effect on climate is negligible on a global scale, but pronounced over the land in the temperate and high northern latitudes where a cooling due to an increase in land surface albedo offsets the warming due to land-use CO2 emissions. Land cover changes led to estimated increases in atmospheric CO2 of between 22 and 43 ppmv. Over the entire period 1800-2000, simulated delta(13)CO(2) with HYDE compares most favourably with ice core during 1850-1950 and Cape Grim data, indicating preference of earlier land clearance in HYDE over R\&F. In relative terms, land cover forcing corresponds to 25-49\% of the observed growth in atmospheric CO2. This contribution declined from 36-60\% during 1850-1960 to 4-35\% during 1960-2000. CLIMBER-2-LPJ simulates the land cover contribution to atmospheric CO2 growth to decrease from 68\% during 1900-1960 to 12\% in the 1980s. Overall, our simulations show a decline in the relative role of land cover changes for atmospheric CO2 increase during the last 150 years.},

The New Zealand avifauna contains a large number of species that have gone through bottlenecks of varying severity, providing an exceptional opportunity to test this question by using the comparative method. Using decreased hatchability as a measure of fitness costs, we found that hatching failure was significantly greater among both native and introduced species that had passed through bottlenecks of {\textless}150 individuals. Comparisons between pre- and postbottleneck populations of introduced species suggest that hatching problems arise even in populations founded by {\textless}600 individuals. Our study confirms that hatching failure is widespread and persistent among birds passing through severe bottlenecks and that the population sizes at which this fitness cost is expressed are several times greater than the number of individuals currently used to found most new populations of endangered species. We recommend that conservation managers revise the protocols they use for reintroductions or they may unwittingly reduce the long-term viability of the species they are trying to save.},

@article{lin_derivation_2009,
	Abstract = {The analysis of large data sets concerning fires in various forested areas of the world has pointed out that burned areas can often be described by different power-law distributions for small, medium and large fires and that a scaling law for the time intervals separating successive fires is fulfilled. The attempts of deriving such statistical laws from purely theoretical arguments have not been fully successful so far, most likely because important physical and/or biological factors controlling forest fires were not taken into account. By contrast, the two-layer spatially extended forest model we propose in this paper encapsulates the main characteristics of vegetational growth and fire ignition and propagation, and supports the empirically discovered statistical laws. Since the model is fully deterministic and spatially homogeneous, the emergence of the power and scaling laws does not seem to necessarily require meteorological randomness and geophysical heterogeneity, although these factors certainly amplify the chaoticity of the fires. Moreover, the analysis suggests that the existence of different power-laws for fires of various scale might be due to the two-layer structure of the forest which allows the formation of different kinds of fires, i.e. surface, crown, and mixed fires.

	Abstract = {Aim  To compare theoretical approaches towards estimating risks of plant species loss to anthropogenic climate change impacts in a biodiversity hotspot, and to develop a practical method to detect signs of climate change impacts on natural populations. Location  The Fynbos biome of South Africa, within the Cape Floristic Kingdom. Methods  Bioclimatic modelling was used to identify environmental limits for vegetation at both biome and species scale. For the biome as a whole, and for 330 species of the endemic family Proteaceae, tolerance limits were determined for five temperature and water availability-related parameters assumed critical for plant survival. Climate scenarios for 2050 generated by the general circulation models HadCM2 and CSM were interpolated for the region. Geographic Information Systems-based methods were used to map current and future modelled ranges of the biome and 330 selected species. In the biome-based approach, predictions of biome areal loss were overlayed with species richness data for the family Proteaceae to estimate extinction risk. In the species-based approach, predictions of range dislocation (no overlap between current range and future projected range) were used as an indicator of extinction risk. A method of identifying local populations imminently threatened by climate change-induced mortality is also described. Results  A loss of Fynbos biome area of between 51\% and 65\% is projected by 2050 (depending on the climate scenario used), and roughly 10\% of the endemic Proteaceae have ranges restricted to the area lost. Species range projections suggest that a third could suffer complete range dislocation by 2050, and only 5\% could retain more than two thirds of their range. Projected changes to individual species ranges could be sufficient to detect climate change impacts within ten years. Main conclusions  The biome-level approach appears to underestimate the risk of species diversity loss from climate change impacts in the Fynbos Biome because many narrow range endemics suffer range dislocation throughout the biome, and not only in areas identified as biome contractions. We suggest that targeted vulnerable species could be monitored both for early warning signs of climate change and as empirical tests of predictions.},

	Abstract = {Can a difference in the heights at which plants place their leaves, a pattern we call canopy partitioning, make it possible for two competing plant species to coexist? To find out, we examine a model of clonal plants living in a nonseasonal environment that relates the dynamical behavior and competitive abilities of plant populations to the structural and functional features of the plants that form them. This examination emphasizes whole plant performance in the vertical light gradient caused by self-shading. This first of three related papers formulates a prototype single species CANOPY STRUCTURE MODEL from biological first principles and shows how all plant properties work together to determine population persistence and equilibrium abundance. Population persistence is favored, and equilibrium abundance is increased, by high irradiance, high maximum photosynthesis rate, rapid saturation of the photosynthetic response to increased irradiance, low tissue respiration rate, small amounts of stem and root tissue necessary to support the needs of leaves, and low density of leaf, stem, and root tissues. In particular, equilibrium abundance decreases as mean leaf height increases because of the increased cost of manufacturing and maintaining stem tissue. All conclusions arise from this formulation by straightforward analysis. The argument concludes by stating this formulation's straightforward extension, called a CANOPY PARTITIONING MODEL, to two competing species. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Ensuring the sustainability of Africa's natural protected areas requires information on the efficacy of management decisions at large spatial scales, but often neither experimental treatments nor large-scale responses are available for analysis. Using a new airborne remote sensing system, we mapped the three-dimensional (3-D) structure of vegetation at a spatial resolution of 56 cm throughout 1640 ha of savanna after 6-, 22-, 35-, and 41-year exclusions of herbivores, as well as in unprotected areas, across Kruger National Park in South Africa. Areas in which herbivores were excluded over the short term (6 years) contained 38\%-80\% less bare ground compared with those that were exposed to mammalian herbivory. In the longer-term ({\textgreater} 22 years), the 3-D structure of woody vegetation differed significantly between protected and accessible landscapes, with up to 11-fold greater woody canopy cover in the areas without herbivores. Our maps revealed 2 scales of ecosystem response to herbivore consumption, one broadly mediated by geologic substrate and the other mediated by hillslope-scale variation in soil nutrient availability and moisture conditions. Our results are the first to quantitatively illustrate the extent to which herbivores can affect the 3D structural diversity of vegetation across large savanna landscapes.},

	Abstract = {Aim

Convergent evolution and environmental filtering are assumed to often result in deterministic patterns of vegetation structure and function in relation to prevailing environmental conditions regardless of differences in evolutionary history among regions. We systematically evaluate the degree to which biomes located in different biogeographic realms converge in environmental space; identifying globally uniform entities and those diverging systematically among realms.


Location

Global.


Methods

Two global biome distribution maps constructed using contrasting approaches are used to evaluate convergence in the environmental space occupied by biomes across biogeographic realms. Environmental conditions are summarized using nine climatic and two edaphic variables known to directly influence plant distributions. Biome maps are analysed accounting for differences in the availability of environments among realms.


Results

The same biome located in two different realms often overlaps no more in environmental space than two altogether different biomes, with the average overlap on the two biome maps calculated using Schoener's D metric only 0.42 and 0.36. This suggests that the coarse structural and phenological characteristics used to define biomes conceal important differences in plant functioning and responses to environmental drivers. Nonetheless, some biomes, in particular savannas and boreal forests, show high overlap among realms. Others, like mediterranean-type ecosystems and treeless biomes, often occur in vastly different regions of environmental space. Within most biomes though overlap varies greatly depending on the specific realms being compared, with historical biogeography and evolutionary history helping to explain this variation.


Main conclusions

Biomes often occur under different environmental conditions when comparing regions with distinct evolutionary and environmental histories. The biome concept and efforts to model current and future vegetation patterns needs to be adapted to account for the role of history in determining how vegetation responds to environmental drivers and disturbance.},

To complement experiments focused on resolving mechanisms of drought-induced tree mortality, an evaluation of how patterns of tree die-off relate to highly spatially variable precipitation is needed.


* Here, we explore precipitation relationships with a die-off event of pinyon pine (Pinus edulis Engelm.) in southwestern North America during the 2002--2003 global-change-type drought. Pinyon die-off and its relationship with precipitation was quantified spatially along a precipitation gradient in north-central New Mexico with standard field plot measurements of die-off combined with canopy cover derived from normalized burn ratio (NBR) from Landsat imagery.


* Pinyon die-off patterns revealed threshold responses to precipitation (cumulative 2002--2003) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD), with little to no mortality ({\textless} 10\%) above 600 mm and below warm season VPD of c. 1.7 kPa. [Correction added after online publication 17 June 2013; in the preceding sentence, the word `below' has been inserted.]


* Our results refine how precipitation patterns within a region influence pinyon die-off, revealing a precipitation and VPD threshold for tree mortality and its uncertainty band where other factors probably come into play -- a response type that influences stand demography and landscape heterogeneity and is of general interest, yet has not been documented.},

	Abstract = {In this review, we discuss the evolution of xylem structure in the context of our current understanding of the biophysics of water transport in plants. Water transport in land plants occurs while water is under negative pressure and is thus in a metastable state. Vessels filled with metastable water are prone to dysfunction by cavitation whenever gas-filled voids appear in the vessel lumen. Cavitated vessels fill with air and are incapable of water transport until air bubbles dissolve. We know much more about how cavitations occur and the conditions under which air bubbles (embolisms) dissolve. This gives us an improved understanding of the relationship between xylem structure and function. We argue that the efficiency of water transport increases in vessels with increasing diameter. The vulnerability of large diameter vessels to frost-induced embolism is dramatically increased. Thus there is a selection for small diameter vessels in cold climates. The relationship between vessel diameter and vulnerability of large diameter vessels to drought-induced embolism is much weaker. The correlation is too weak to permit comparative physiologists to predict vulnerability based on vessel diameter, but the correlation is strong enough to be of some evolutionary significance.},

However, the quantitative uncertainty in the net feedback is large. The uncertainty in 21st-century carbon dioxide emissions resulting from terrestrial carbon cycle-climate feedbacks is second in magnitude only to the uncertainty in anthropogenic emissions. We estimate that this translates into an uncertainty in global warming owing to the land surface of 1.5 degrees degrees C by 2100.

Island biogeographic theory has identified the roles of immigration and extinction in relation to area size and proximity to source areas, and the role of speciation is also recognized as an important factor. However, one as yet unexplored possibility is that species diversity itself might help to promote speciation, and indeed the central tenets of island biogeographic theory support such a prediction. Here we use data for plants and arthropods of the volcanic archipelagos of the Canary and Hawaiian Islands to address whether there is a positive relationship between species diversity and rate of diversification. Our index of diversification for each island is the proportion of species that are endemic, and we test our prediction that this increases with increasing species number. We show that even after controlling for several important physical features of islands, diversification is strongly related to species number.},

	Abstract = {Classical biogeographical observations suggest that ecosystems are strongly shaped by climatic constraints in terms of their structure and function. On the other hand, vegetation function feeds back on the climate system via biosphere--atmosphere exchange of matter and energy. Ecosystem-level observations of this exchange reveal very large functional biogeographical variation of climate-relevant ecosystem functional properties related to carbon and water cycles. This variation is explained insufficiently by climate control and a classical plant functional type classification approach. For example, correlations between seasonal carbon-use efficiency and climate or environmental variables remain below 0.6, leaving almost 70\% of variance unexplained. We suggest that a substantial part of this unexplained variation of ecosystem functional properties is related to variations in plant and microbial traits. Therefore, to progress with global functional biogeography, we should seek to understand the link between organismic traits and flux-derived ecosystem properties at ecosystem observation sites and the spatial variation of vegetation traits given geoecological covariates. This understanding can be fostered by synergistic use of both data-driven and theory-driven ecological as well as biophysical approaches.},

	Abstract = {Precise measurements in air are helping to clarify the fate of CO2 released by human activities. Oxygen-to-nitrogen ratios in firn (the transition state from snow to ice) and archived air samples indicate that the terrestrial biosphere was approximately carbon-neutral on average during the 1980s. CO2 release by forest clearance during this period must have been compensated for by CO2 sinks elsewhere on land. Direct atmospheric O-2:N-2 measurements became available during the 1990s. These measurements indicate net terrestrial CO2 uptake of similar to2 Pg C/yr. From the north-south O-2:N-2 gradient, it has been inferred that about this amount was taken up by terrestrial ecosystems in the northern nontropics while additional CO2 released by tropical-forest clearance must have been compensated for by additional, tropical, terrestrial CO2 sinks. These and other atmospheric observations provide independent tests of carbon-cycle reconstructions made with process-based terrestrial ecosystem models. Such models can account for major features of the atmospheric-CO2 record, including the amplitude and phase of the seasonal cycle of atmospheric-CO2 concentration at different latitudes, and much of the interannual variability in the rate of increase of atmospheric CO2. Models also predict direct effects of rising atmospheric-CO2 concentration on primary production, modified by feedbacks at the plant and ecosystem levels. These effects translate into a global carbon sink the right order of magnitude to compensate for forest clearance during the 1980s. The modeled sink depends on continuously increasing CO2 to maintain disequilibrium between primary production and carbon storage. There are still substantial differences among the carbon-balance estimates made by different models, reflecting limitations in current understanding of ecosystem-level responses to atmospheric-CO2 concentration, especially with regard to the interactions of C and N cycling and interactions with land-use change. Scenario calculations nevertheless agree that if atmospheric CO2 continues its rise unchecked then the terrestrial sink will start to decline by the middle of the next century, for reasons including saturation of the direct CO2 effect on photosynthesis.},

	Abstract = {Carbon-use efficiency (CUE), the ratio of net primary production (NPP) to gross primary production (GPP), describes the capacity of forests to transfer carbon (C) from the atmosphere to terrestrial biomass. It is widely assumed in many landscape-scale carbon-cycling models that CUE for forests is a constant value of similar to 0.5. To achieve a constant CUE, tree respiration must be a constant fraction of canopy photosynthesis. We conducted a literature survey to test the hypothesis that CUE is constant and universal among forest ecosystems. Of the 60 data points obtained from 26 papers published since 1975, more than half reported values of GPP that were not estimated independently from NPP; values of CUE calculated from independent estimates of GPP were greater than those calculated from estimates of GPP derived from NPP. The slope of the relationship between NPP and GPP for all forests was 0.53, but values of CUE varied from 0.23 to 0.83 for different forest types. CUE decreased with increasing age, and a substantial portion of the variation among forest types was caused by differences in stand age. When corrected for age the mean value of CUE was greatest for temperate deciduous forests and lowest for boreal forests. CUE also increased as the ratio of leaf mass-to-total mass increased. Contrary to the assumption of constancy, substantial variation in CUE has been reported in the literature. It may be inappropriate to assume that respiration is a constant fraction of GPP as adhering to this assumption may contribute to incorrect estimates of C cycles. A 20\% error in current estimates of CUE used in landscape models (i.e. ranging from 0.4 to 0.6) could misrepresent an amount of C equal to total anthropogenic emissions of CO2 when scaled to the terrestrial biosphere.},

	Abstract = {Bringing together leaf trait data spanning 2,548 species and 175 sites we describe, for the first time at global scale, a universal spectrum of leaf economics consisting of key chemical, structural and physiological properties. The spectrum runs from quick to slow return on investments of nutrients and dry mass in leaves, and operates largely independently of growth form, plant functional type or biome. Categories along the spectrum would, in general, describe leaf economic variation at the global scale better than plant functional types, because functional types overlap substantially in their leaf traits. Overall, modulation of leaf traits and trait relationships by climate is surprisingly modest, although some striking and significant patterns can be seen. Reliable quantification of the leaf economics spectrum and its interaction with climate will prove valuable for modelling nutrient fluxes and vegetation boundaries under changing land-use and climate.},

	Abstract = {Measurements of the net CO2 flux between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere using the eddy covariance technique have the potential to underpin our interpretation of regional CO2 source-sink patterns, CO2 flux responses to forcings, and predictions of the future terrestrial C balance. Information contained in FLUXNET eddy covariance data has multiple uses for the development and application of global carbon models, including evaluation/validation, calibration, process parameterization, and data assimilation. This paper reviews examples of these uses, compares global estimates of the dynamics of the global carbon cycle, and suggests ways of improving the utility of such data for global carbon modelling. Net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) predicted by different terrestrial biosphere models compares favourably with FLUXNET observations at diurnal and seasonal timescales. However, complete model validation, particularly over the full annual cycle, requires information on the balance between assimilation and decomposition processes, information not readily available for most FLUXNET sites. Site history, when known, can greatly help constrain the model-data comparison. Flux measurements made over four vegetation types were used to calibrate the land-surface scheme of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies global climate model, significantly improving simulated climate and demonstrating the utility of diurnal FLUXNET data for climate modelling. Land-surface temperatures in many regions cool due to higher canopy conductances and latent heat fluxes, and the spatial distribution of CO2 uptake provides a significant additional constraint on the realism of simulated surface fluxes. FLUXNET data are used to calibrate a global production efficiency model (PEM). This model is forced by satellite-measured absorbed radiation and suggests that global net primary production (NPP) increased 6.2\% over 1982-1999. Good agreement is found between global trends in NPP estimated by the PEM and a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM), and between the DGVM and estimates of global NEE derived from a global inversion of atmospheric CO2 measurements. Combining the PEM, DGVM, and inversion results suggests that CO2 fertilization is playing a major role in current increases in NPP, with lesser impacts from increasing N deposition and growing season length. Both the PEM and the inversion identify the Amazon basin as a key region for the current net terrestrial CO2 uptake (i.e. 33\% of global NEE), as well as its interannual variability. The inversion's global NEE estimate of -1.2 Pg [C] yr(-1) for 1982-1995 is compatible with the PEM- and DGVM-predicted trends in NPP. There is, thus, a convergence in understanding derived from process-based models, remote-sensing-based observations, and inversion of atmospheric data. Future advances in field measurement techniques, including eddy covariance (particularly concerning the problem of night-time fluxes in dense canopies and of advection or flow distortion over complex terrain), will result in improved constraints on land-atmosphere CO2 fluxes and the rigorous attribution of mechanisms to the current terrestrial net CO2 uptake and its spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Global ecosystem models play a fundamental role in linking information derived from FLUXNET measurements to atmospheric CO2 variability. A number of recommendations concerning FLUXNET data are made, including a request for more comprehensive site data (particularly historical information), more measurements in undisturbed ecosystems, and the systematic provision of error estimates. The greatest value of current FLUXNET data for global carbon cycle modelling is in evaluating process representations, rather than in providing an unbiased estimate of net CO2 exchange.},

	Abstract = {1. Fire is important in the dynamics of savanna-forest boundaries, often maintaining a balance between forest advance and retreat. 2. We performed a comparative ecological study to understand how savanna and forest species differ in traits related to fire tolerance. We compared bark thickness, root and stem carbohydrates, and height of reproductive individuals within 10 congeneric pairs, each containing one savanna and one forest species. 3. Bark thickness of savanna species averaged nearly three times that of forest species, thereby reducing the risk of stem death during fire. The allometric relationship between bark thickness and stem diameter differed between these two tree types, with forest species tending to have a larger allometric coefficient. 4. The height of reproductive individuals of forest species averaged twice that of congeneric savanna species. This should increase the time necessary for forest species to reach reproductive size, thereby reducing their capacity to reach maturity in the time between consecutive fires. 5. There was no difference in total non-structural carbohydrate content of stems or roots between savanna and forest species, though greater allocation to total root biomass by savanna species probably confers greater capacity to resprout following fire. 6. These differences in fire-related traits may largely explain the greater capacity of savanna species to persist in the savanna environment.},

	Abstract = {The effects of elevated CO2 on plant growth and insect herbivory have been frequently investigated over the past 20 years. Most studies have shown an increase in plant growth, a decrease in plant nitrogen concentration, an increase in plant secondary metabolites and a decrease in herbivory. However, such studies have generally overlooked the fact that increases in plant production could cause increases of herbivores per unit area of habitat. Our study investigated leaf production, herbivory levels and herbivore abundance per unit area of leaf litter in a scrub-oak system at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, under conditions of ambient and elevated CO2, over an 11-year period, from 1996 to 2007. In every year, herbivory, that is leafminer and leaftier abundance per 200 leaves, was lower under elevated CO2 than ambient CO2 for each of three species of oaks, Quercus myrtifolia, Quercus chapmanii and Quercus geminata. However, leaf litter production per 0.1143 m(2) was greater under elevated CO2 than ambient CO2 for Q. myrtifolia and Q. chapmanii, and this difference increased over the 11 years of the study. Leaf production of Q. geminata under elevated CO2 did not increase. Leafminer densities per 0.1143 m(2) of litterfall for Q. myrtifolia and Q. chapmanii were initially lower under elevated CO2. However, shortly after canopy closure in 2001, leafminer densities per 0.1143 m(2) of litter fall became higher under elevated CO2 and remained higher for the remainder of the experiment. Leaftier densities per 0.1143 m(2) were also higher under elevated CO2 for Q. myrtifolia and Q. chapmanii over the last 6 years of the experiment. There were no differences in leafminer or leaftier densities per 0.1143 m(2) of litter for Q. geminata. These results show three phenomena. First, they show that elevated CO2 decreases herbivory on all oak species in the Florida scrub-oak system. Second, despite lower numbers of herbivores per 200 leaves in elevated CO2, increased leaf production resulted in higher herbivore densities per unit area of leaf litter for two oak species. Third, they corroborate other studies which suggest that the effects of elevated CO2 on herbivores are species specific, meaning they depend on the particular plant species involved. Two oak species showed increases in leaf production and herbivore densities per 0.1143 m(2) in elevated CO2 over time while another oak species did not. Our results point to a future world of elevated CO2 where, despite lower plant herbivory, some insect herbivores may become more common.},

@article{rohrig_model_2001,
	Abstract = {A precise prediction of the yield losses inflicted by weeds is the basis of decisions in weed management. Hitherto. only rough estimates, which neglect the specific production situation have been available for vegetable crops. In this study a simple simulation model was developed to estimate yield loss by radiation competition as a function of environmental variables. In the model, the distribution of incoming photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in the canopy is calculated using a spatially highly resolved approach. Growth is calculated as a function of absorbed radiation and its utilisation. Newly produced dry matter is allocated to roots and shoots, the latter comprising vegetative and reproductive organs according to the developmental stage. Vegetative shoot dry matter is partitioned according to the main functions of radiation interception (leaves) and structural stability (stems and petioles). The resulting leaf area is distributed in the canopy according to the spatial expansion of individual plants. Calibration runs revealed uncertainties predicting the growth of Chenopodium album and a high sensitivity of crop yield to leaf area development of the weed. Using the area of green leaves (LAI) of C. album as input gave a close correspondence between simulated and observed crop yield loss. Since plant height of C. album is calculated as a function of leaf area, this variable has a multiple effect on radiation absorption. A first evaluation with an independent data set likewise gave an acceptable prediction. To reduce model complexity, a simplified version is proposed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

This is the first generic derivation from ODE theory of the so-called C-bifurcation (or border collision) for piecewise-linear maps. The result contrasts with the equivalent results when a periodic orbit grazes with a smooth discontinuity set, which has recently been shown to lead to maps that have continuous first derivatives but not second. Moreover, it is shown how to calculate the piecewise-linear map for arbitrary dimensional systems, using only properties of the single periodic trajectory undergoing corner collision. The calculation is worked out for two examples, including a model for a commonly used power electronic converter where complex dynamics associated with corner collision was previously found numerically, but is explained analytically here for the first time.

Resource pulsing is a special form of environmental variation, and the general theory of coexistence in variable environments suggests specific mechanisms by which rainfall variability might contribute to the maintenance of high species diversity in and ecosystems. In this review, we discuss physiological, morphological, and life-history traits that facilitate plant survival and growth in strongly water-limited variable environments, outlining how species differences in these traits may promote diversity. Our analysis emphasizes that the variability of pulsed environments does not reduce the importance of species interactions in structuring communities, but instead provides axes of ecological differentiation between species that facilitate their coexistence. Pulses of rainfall also influence higher trophic levels and entire food webs. Better understanding of how rainfall affects the diversity, species composition, and dynamics of and environments can contribute to solving environmental problems stemming from land use and global climate change.},

Thus, over time, the strategy mix should evolve to some type of optimal or stable state. Maynard Smith and Price (1973) have introduced the concept of ESS (evolutionarily stable strategy) to describe a stable state of the game. We attempt to model the dynamics of the game both in the continuous case, with a system of non-linear first-order differential equations, and in the discrete case, with a system of non-linear difference equations. Using this model, we look at the notions of stability and asymptotic behavior. Our notion of stable equilibrium for the continuous dynamic includes, but is somewhat more general than, the notion of ESS.},

	Abstract = {Climate change science is increasingly concerned with methods for managing and integrating sources of uncertainty from emission storylines, climate model projections, and ecosystem model parameterizations. In tropical ecosystems, regional climate projections and modeled ecosystem responses vary greatly, leading to a significant source of uncertainty in global biogeochemical accounting and possible future climate feedbacks. Here, we combine an ensemble of IPCC-AR4 climate change projections for the Amazon Basin (eight general circulation models) with alternative ecosystem parameter sets for the dynamic global vegetation model, LPJmL. We evaluate LPJmL simulations of carbon stocks and fluxes against flux tower and aboveground biomass datasets for individual sites and the entire basin. Variability in LPJmL model sensitivity to future climate change is primarily related to light and water limitations through biochemical and water-balance-related parameters. Temperature-dependent parameters related to plant respiration and photosynthesis appear to be less important than vegetation dynamics (and their parameters) for determining the magnitude of ecosystem response to climate change. Variance partitioning approaches reveal that relationships between uncertainty from ecosystem dynamics and climate projections are dependent on geographic location and the targeted ecosystem process. Parameter uncertainty from the LPJmL model does not affect the trajectory of ecosystem response for a given climate change scenario and the primary source of uncertainty for Amazon `dieback' results from the uncertainty among climate projections. Our approach for describing uncertainty is applicable for informing and prioritizing policy options related to mitigation and adaptation where long-term investments are required.},

	Abstract = {The allocation of resources among roots and shoots represents the largest flux of resources within a plant and therefore should have been selected to maximize benefits to plants. Yet, it is unclear why some species like temperate grasses have such high root length density (RLD). Either the slow rate of diffusion of inorganic N in soils or interplant competition could explain the high RLD of temperate grasses. Using a fine-scale model of nutrient dynamics in the soil and plant growth, a cost-benefit approach was used to assess optimal allocation rates for plants that accounted for value of both carbon and nitrogen. In the absence of interplant competition, resource benefits are maximized with very little root length except in extremely dry soils for ammonium. In the presence of a competitor, optimal allocation of N to roots is much greater and increases as ability of competitors to produce root length increase. Competition for inorganic nitrogen generates a classic aspect of the tragedy of the commons, the "race for fish", where plants must allocate more resources to acquisition of the limiting resource than is optimal for plants in the absence of competition. As such, nutrient competition needs to be directly addressed when understanding plant- and ecosystem-level resource fluxes as well as the evolution of root systems.},

	Abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. C(4) grasses possess characteristics that potentially advantage growth in fire-prone environments, including high photosynthetic productivity, efficient light and nutrient use and significant allocation to below-ground reserves and reproduction. Such characteristics allow fast regeneration after fire, and may be the consequence of photosynthetic physiology, phylogenetic ancestry or may have been acquired as adaptations to frequently burnt environments. 2. The aim of this study was to examine the role of photosynthetic pathway by comparing fire ecology in the closely related C(3) and C(4) subspecies of Alloteropsis semialata. Its focus was on above-ground characteristics that would contribute to a fire fuel load, and the re-growth responses of plants subsequent to a controlled experimental burn during the natural winter fire season. 3. Prior to the burn, but after frost, above-ground biomass was entirely dead in the C(4) plants, and was more flammable than that of the C(3) plants. C(3) plants maintained 33\% of their canopy alive despite frosts and hence lost a significant proportion of living tissue in the experimental burn. 4. Subsequent to the burn, C(3) plants did not entirely recover their above-ground biomass, but canopy area returned to its pre-burn level through the production of leaves with greater specific leaf area. There was little evidence of the remobilization of below-ground reserves, which were less than half the size of C(4) reserves. Re-growth of C(4) plants was strongly supported by the reallocation of below-ground biomass and was similar for burnt and control plants, although fire had a weak stimulatory effect on re-growth. 5. Synthesis. Differences in the responses of the A. semialata subspecies indicated that the C(4) subspecies is better adapted to fire. Not only did it produce a flammable fuel load, but it was not detrimentally affected by the fire and recovered more rapidly than the C(3) subspecies, without the requirement for altered growth allometry. Such characteristics may be the direct consequence of photosynthetic pathway or an indirect effect of adaptation in the C(3) and C(4) subspecies to environments with differing fire regimes.},

In this paper we present a model for the local competition for soil moisture among neighboring vegetation. The initial condition for the model is a random field where at each point the soil moisture is the mean water content when there are no spatial interactions between sites. The mean soil moisture values account for stochasticity of climate and losses from evapotranspiration and leakage which depend on the existing water content. A spatial dynamics is then implemented based on the explicit minimization of the global water stress over the region. This approach explains the coexistence of herbaceous and woody plants in savannas as well as the changes in canopy density that have been documented in the southwest of the United States as a function of regional climatic fluctuations.},

	Abstract = {In this work, important aspects of bacteriocin producing bacteria and their interplay are elucidated. Various attempts to model the resistant, producer and sensitive Escherichia coli strains in the so-called rock-scissors-paper (RSP) game had been made in the literature. The question arose whether there is a continuous model with a cyclic structure and admitting an oscillatory dynamics as observed in various experiments. The May-Leonard system admits a Hopf bifurcation, which is, however, degenerate and hence inadequate. The traditional differential equation model of the RSP-game cannot be applied either to the bacteriocin system because it involves positive interaction terms. In this paper, a plausible competitive Lotka-Volterra system model of the RSP game is presented and the dynamics generated by that model is analyzed. For the first time, a continuous, spatially homogeneous model that describes the competitive interaction between bacteriocin-producing, resistant and sensitive bacteria is established. The interaction terms have negative coefficients. In some experiments, for example, in mice cultures, migration seemed to be essential for the reinfection in the RSP cycle. Often statistical and spatial effects such as migration and mutation are regarded to be essential for periodicity. Our model gives rise to oscillatory dynamics in the RSP game without such effects. Here, a normal form description of the limit cycle and conditions for its stability are derived. The toxicity of the bacteriocin is used as a bifurcation parameter. Exact parameter ranges are obtained for which a stable (robust) limit cycle and a stable heteroclinic cycle exist in the three-species game. These parameters are in good accordance with the observed relations for the E. coli strains. The roles of growth rate and growth yield of the three strains are discussed. Numerical calculations show that the sensitive, which might be regarded as the weakest, can have the longest sojourn times.},

	Abstract = {Plant population modelling has been around since the 1970s, providing a valuable approach to understanding plant ecology from a mechanistic standpoint. It is surprising then that this area of research has not grown in prominence with respect to other approaches employed in modelling plant systems. In this review, we provide an analysis of the development and role of modelling in the field of plant population biology through an exploration of where it has been, where it is now and, in our opinion, where it should be headed. We focus, in particular, on the role plant population modelling could play in ecological forecasting, an urgent need given current rates of regional and global environmental change. We suggest that a critical element limiting the current application of plant population modelling in environmental research is the trade-off between the necessary resolution and detail required to accurately characterize ecological dynamics pitted against the goal of generality, particularly at broad spatial scales. In addition to suggestions how to overcome the current shortcoming of data on the process-level we discuss two emerging strategies that may offer a way to overcome the described limitation: (1) application of a modern approach to spatial scaling from local processes to broader levels of interaction and (2) plant functional-type modelling. Finally we outline what we believe to be needed in developing these approaches towards a 'science of forecasting'. (c) 2007 Rubel Foundation, ETH Zurich. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

Location Central Tropical Africa. Methods We compared a new analysis of satellite tree cover data with botanical, phytogeographical and environmental data. Results Along the climatic transect, six vegetation structures were distinguished according to their average tree cover, which can co-occur as mosaics. The resulting abrupt shifts in tree cover were not correlated to any shifts in either environmental variables or in tree species distributions. Main conclusions A strong contrast appears between fine-scale variability in tree cover and coarse-scale structural states that are stable over several degrees of latitude. While climate parameters and species pools display a continuous evolution along the climatic gradient, these stable structural states have discontinuous transitions, resulting in regions containing mosaics of alternative stable states. Soils appear to have little effect inside the climatic stable state domains but a strong action on the location of the transitions. This indicates that savannas are patch dynamics systems, prone to feedbacks stabilizing their coarse-scale structure over wide ranges of environmental conditions.},

	Abstract = {Predicting changes in potential habitat for endangered species as a result of global warming requires considering more than future climate conditions; it is also necessary to evaluate biotic associations. Most distribution models predicting species responses to climate change include climate variables and occasionally topographic and edaphic parameters, rarely are biotic interactions included. Here, we incorporate biotic interactions into niche models to predict suitable habitat for species under altered climates. We constructed and evaluated niche models for an endangered butterfly and a threatened bird species, both are habitat specialists restricted to semiarid shrublands of southern California. To incorporate their dependency on shrubs, we first developed climate-based niche models for shrubland vegetation and individual shrub species. We also developed models for the butterfly's larval host plants. Outputs from these models were included in the environmental variable dataset used to create butterfly and bird niche models. For both animal species, abiotic-biotic models outperformed the climate-only model, with climate-only models over-predicting suitable habitat under current climate conditions. We used the climate-only and abiotic-biotic models to calculate amounts of suitable habitat under altered climates and to evaluate species' sensitivities to climate change. We varied temperature (+0.6, +1.7, and +2.8 degrees C) and precipitation (50\%, 90\%, 100\%, 110\%, and 150\%) relative to current climate averages and within ranges predicted by global climate change models. Suitable habitat for each species was reduced at all levels of temperature increase. Both species were sensitive to precipitation changes, particularly increases. Under altered climates, including biotic variables reduced habitat by 68-100\% relative to the climate-only model. To design reserve systems conserving sensitive species under global warming, it is important to consider biotic interactions, particularly for habitat specialists and species with strong dependencies on other species.},

	Abstract = {The basic transport-resistance (TR) model of shoot[ratio]root carbon[ratio]nitrogen allocation is described. This approach assumes that the two processes of substrate transport and chemical conversion determine allocation. It is suggested thatallallocation models, whether built for the purposes of theoretical investigation or practical application, should start with this irreducible framework. Here it is assumed that the processes operate according to: (a) for substrate sources, dependence on shoot and root sizes with possible product inhibition; (b) for transport, movement down a substrate concentration gradient; and (c) for substrate sinks or utilization, linear bisubstrate kinetics. Some dynamic properties of the model are explored. Failure of this approach to allocation flags the need for additional mechanisms to control the processes. Details of the failure will indicate the modifications needed, which may involve hormones or reflect teleonomy (apparently goal-seeking behaviour), and which are added to the irreducible framework. However, these additions should not replace the irreducible framework of transport and chemical conversions, because they do not in reality. Modifications to the basic model to represent possibilities such as ontogenesis with the transition from exponential growth towards a steady state or with the scaling of within-plant transport resistances with plant size, the influence of hormones, and active transport, are described.Copyright 1998 Annals of Botany Company},

	Abstract = {A soil-plant-atmosphere model was used to estimate gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) of a tropical savanna in Australia. This paper describes model modifications required to simulate the substantial C4 grass understory together with C3 trees. The model was further improved to include a seasonal distribution of leaf area and foliar nitrogen through 10 canopy layers. Model outputs were compared with a 5-year eddy covariance dataset. Adding the C4 photosynthesis component improved the model efficiency and root-mean-squared error (RMSE) for total ecosystem GPP by better emulating annual peaks and troughs in GPP across wet and dry seasons. The C4 photosynthesis component had minimal impact on modelled values of ET. Outputs of GPP from the modified model agreed well with measured values, explaining between 79\% and 90\% of the variance and having a low RMSE (0.003-0.281 g C m(-2) day(-1)). Approximately, 40\% of total annual GPP was contributed by C4 grasses. Total (trees and grasses) wet season GPP was approximately 75-80\% of total annual GPP. Light-use efficiency (LUE) was largest for the wet season and smallest in the dry season and C4 LUE was larger than that of the trees. A sensitivity analysis of GPP revealed that daily GPP was most sensitive to changes in leaf area index (LAI) and foliar nitrogen (N-f) and relatively insensitive to changes in maximum carboxylation rate (V-cmax), maximum electron transport rate (J(max)) and minimum leaf water potential (Psi(min)). The modified model was also able to represent daily and seasonal patterns in ET, (explaining 68-81\% of variance) with a low RMSE (0.038-0.19 mm day(-1)). Current values of N-f, LAI and other parameters appear to be colimiting for maximizing GPP. By manipulating LAI and soil moisture content inputs, we show that modelled GPP is limited by light interception rather than water availability at this site.},

Biomass estimates range between a gain of 6.2 and a loss of 2.7 kg carbon m−2 for the Amazon region, depending on the strength of CO2 fertilization. * *The uncertainty associated with the long-term effect of CO2 is much larger than that associated with precipitation change. This underlines the importance of reducing uncertainties in the direct effects of CO2 on tropical ecosystems.},

	Abstract = {The accuracy of plant growth models depends strongly on a precise calculation of radiation uptake, Numerous approaches exist to estimate light absorption in spatially heterogeneous canopies, but these either have restrictions with respect to canopy structure or involve complex and inflexible calculations. The objective of this study was to develop a simulation tool to assess radiation penetration into canopies that should (i) give details on light absorption in heterogeneous canopy architectures and (ii) comprise simple and easily adaptable routines. In the model, the complete canopy volume is subdivided into cubic units that are either empty or filled with leaf area. Leaf area can be distributed in an arbitrarily chosen geometric solid positioned anywhere in the model domain. Transmission through the cubes is calculated by following the path of solar rays from the top of the canopy to ground level, Daily canopy absorption is calculated separately for direct and diffuse radiation, taking reflection and scattering of the direct beam into account. Using only a few readily obtainable parameters, a close agreement between simulated and measured canopy transmission of a cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis L.) crop sas found (r(2) = 0.97). Comparing different canopy structures ranging from single-plant canopies to a closed canopy gave detailed information on the absorption characteristics and the distribution of light absorption in individual plants. Results for closed canopies and row crops were consistent with those of earlier models It is thus useful as a reference model to identify possible simplifications in the quantification of light interception by heterogeneous crops.},

We expect, therefore, that natural vegetation would evolve optimally to maximize its net carbon profit (N-CP), the difference between carbon acquired by photosynthesis and carbon spent on maintenance of the organs involved in its uptake. We modelled N-CP for an optimal vegetation for a site in the wet-dry tropics of north Australia based on this hypothesis and on an ecophysiological gas exchange and photosynthesis model, and compared the modelled CO2 fluxes and canopy properties with observations from the site. The comparison gives insights into theoretical and real controls on gas exchange and canopy structure, and supports the optimality approach for the modelling of gas exchange of natural vegetation. The main advantage of the optimality approach we adopt is that no assumptions about the particular vegetation of a site are required, making it a very powerful tool for predicting vegetation response to long-term climate or land use change.},

	Abstract = {* How plants respond to climate change is of major concern, as plants will strongly impact future ecosystem functioning, food production and climate. Here, we investigated how vegetation structure and functioning may be influenced by predicted increases in annual temperatures and atmospheric CO2 concentration, and modeled the extent to which local plant--plant interactions may modify these effects.


* A canopy model was developed, which calculates photosynthesis as a function of light, nitrogen, temperature, CO2 and water availability, and considers different degrees of light competition between neighboring plants through canopy mixing; soybean (Glycine max) was used as a reference system.


* The model predicts increased net photosynthesis and reduced stomatal conductance and transpiration under atmospheric CO2 increase. When CO2 elevation is combined with warming, photosynthesis is increased more, but transpiration is reduced less. Intriguingly, when competition is considered, the optimal response shifts to producing larger leaf areas, but with lower stomatal conductance and associated vegetation transpiration than when competition is not considered. Furthermore, only when competition is considered are the predicted effects of elevated CO2 on leaf area index (LAI) well within the range of observed effects obtained by Free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments.


* Together, our results illustrate how competition between plants may modify vegetation responses to climate change.},

@article{lau_elevated_2009,
	Abstract = {Global environmental changes, such as rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations, have a wide range of direct effects on plant physiology, growth, and fecundity. These environmental changes also can affect plants indirectly by altering interactions with other species. Therefore, the effects of global changes on a particular species may depend on the presence and abundance of other community members. We experimentally manipulated atmospheric CO2 concentration and amounts of herbivore damage (natural insect folivory and clipping to simulate browsing) to examine: (1) how herbivores mediate the effects of elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) on the growth and fitness of Arabidopsis thaliana; and (2) how predicted changes in CO2 concentration affect plant resistance to herbivores, which influences the amount of damage plants receive, and plant tolerance of herbivory, or the fitness consequences of damage. We found no evidence that CO2 altered resistance, but plants grown in eCO(2) were less tolerant of herbivory-clipping reduced aboveground biomass and fruit production by 13 and 22\%, respectively, when plants were reared under eCO(2), but plants fully compensated for clipping in ambient CO2 (aCO(2)) environments. Costs of tolerance in the form of reduced fitness of undamaged plants were detected in eCO(2) but not aCO(2) environments. Increased costs could reduce selection on tolerance in eCO(2) environments, potentially resulting in even larger fitness effects of clipping in predicted future eCO(2) conditions. Thus, environmental perturbations can indirectly affect both the ecology and evolution of plant populations by altering both the intensity of species interactions as well as the fitness consequences of those interactions.},

	Abstract = {We used forest inventories, conducted in seventy-two 1-ha permanent plots to assess the variation in tree and palm aboveground live biomass (AGLB), and its relation with soil gradients (texture and nutrients) and topography (altitude and slope). Our plots, located at Reserva Florestal Adolpho Ducke, a 10,000 ha reserve in central Amazonia, near the city of Manaus, were systematically spread over 64 km2. The plots were long (250 m) and narrow (up to 40 m), following elevational contours. Chemical and physical soil analyses were undertaken using topsoil samples, collected in each plot. The plots covered a soil textural gradient ranging from 8\% to 98\% percent of sand, slopes varying from 0.5$\,^{\circ}$ to 27$\,^{\circ}$, and the maximum difference of altitude among plots was 70 m, ranging from 39 to 109 m a.s.l. The mean total AGLB (palm + trees) for stems over 1 cm diameter breast height (dbh = 1.3 m), was 327.8 Mg/ha (ranging from 210.9 to 426.3) and was similar to other studies in the region. We found a two-fold variation in total AGLB estimates among plots, with soil or topography explaining around 20\% of this variation. AGLB was positively related to either a soil textural gradient (represented by the percentage of clay) or altitude, but was insensitive to slope. Although slope had no detectable effect on the mean variation of AGLB per plot, it explained 14\% of the AGLB in understory and emergent trees. On slopes, AGLB is concentrated mostly in tree classes of small size (1 ≤ dbh \&lt; 10 cm), whereas in flat areas, most of the biomass is concentrated in a few big trees. When considering palms and trees separately, we found that tree biomass tended to increase in clay-rich soils (mostly located in high areas), whereas palm biomass was higher in sandy soils (low slopes and bottomlands). This study shows that forests in central Amazonia grow in a heterogeneous environment in relation to soil and topography, and this heterogeneity seems to be in part responsible for differences in structure and AGLB accumulation. In the forest around Manaus, topography can be used to predict aboveground live biomass as an alternative to soil variables, with similar predictive power. Topographic variables can be easily assessed using satellite imagery and could improve current estimates of carbon stocks over large areas in the Amazon.},

After 400 years of model integration, the global mean annual surface temperature increased by 0.7$\,^{\circ}$K and declined by 0.6$\,^{\circ}$K in the forest and grassland simulations, respectively, as compared to the control simulation. Thereafter, the geographic distribution of vegetation has been allowed to respond interactively to climate. After subsequent 500 years of interactive climate-vegetation dynamics, both forest and grassland simulations converged to essentially the same climate state as in the control simulation.

	Abstract = {Aim While physical constraints influence terrestrial primary productivity, the extent to which geographical variation in productivity is influenced by physiological adaptations and changes in vegetation structure is unclear. Further, quantifying the effect of variability in species traits on ecosystems remains a critical research challenge. Here, we take a macroecological approach and ask if variation in the stoichiometric traits (C: N: P ratios) of plants and primary productivity across global-scale temperature gradients is consistent with a scaling model that integrates recent insights from the theories of metabolic scaling and ecological stoichiometry. Location This study is global in scope, encompassing a wide variety of terrestrial plant communities. Methods We first develop a scaling model that incorporates potentially adaptive variation in leaf and whole-plant nutrient content, kinetic aspects of photosynthesis and plant respiration, and the allometry of biomass partitioning and allocation. We then examine extensive data sets concerning the stoichiometry and productivity of diverse plant communities in light of the model. Results Across diverse ecosystems, both foliar stoichiometry (N : P) and 'nitrogen productivity' (which depends on both community size structure and plant nutrient content) vary systematically across global scale temperature gradients. Primary productivity shows no relationship to temperature. Main conclusions The model predicts that the observed patterns of variation in plant stoichiometry and nutrient productivity may offset the temperature dependence of primary production expected from the kinetics of photosynthesis alone. Our approach provides a quantitative framework for treating potentially adaptive functional variation across communities as a continuum and may thus inform studies of global change. More generally, our approach represents one of the first explicit combinations of ecological stoichiometry and metabolic scaling theories in the analysis of macroecological patterns.},

	Abstract = {1. We tested the generality of global leaf trait relationships among 44 tropical plant species from a broad array of growth forms (trees, lianas and understorey plants) in lowland Panama to determine how leaf trait relationships vary with whole-plant morphology within one site. 2. We observed significant variation among growth forms for seven out of 10 leaf traits. Variation in leaf traits among growth forms was more pronounced per area than per mass. Thirteen bivariate leaf trait relationships that describe how plants allocate resources to photosynthesis were significant across all species. Growth forms showed distinct slopes, intercepts or shifts in the common slope for 12 of the 13 relationships. 3. Trait relationships within trees and lianas showed good agreement with a global leaf trait data set. However, for understorey plants, trait relationships that included specific leaf area (SLA) deviated from the global data set, suggesting that understorey leaf-allocation patterns optimize SLA, and hence growth. 4.

	Abstract = {The effects of the form of the grazing and mortality terms used in plankton models are well known. The same cannot be said for ecosystem models. As ecosystem models become more popular more needs to be known about the effects of model formulation on model behaviour and performance. The impact of the form of the grazing response function and mortality terms used in a biogeochemical ecosystem model are considered here. We show that in the large and inter-linked webs used in ecosystem models, model behaviour is far more sensitive to the form of the grazing term than to that of the mortality terms that close the modelled food web. When using biogeochemical ecosystem models in shallow marine ecosystems, the most dynamic and sophisticated functional responses describing grazing require more parameters and validation than the simpler Holling disk equation, but usually still lead to the same general conclusions about the system state and the effects of changes in forcing functions. Thus, the use of more complex functional responses is not necessarily warranted in many cases. Similarly, the extra effort and data required to explicitly represent the top predators (sharks, mammals and birds) is not necessary if they are not the focus of the study. A quadratic mortality term applied to intermediate predators (such as piscivores) is sufficient to achieve plausible model behaviour. It should be noted, however, that some degree of sophistication is required in the grazing and mortality terms. Use of simple linear functional responses and mortality terms is unsuitable for models used to consider a range of nutrient loading or harvesting scenarios. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

At low densities dispersers are less likely to find mates and establish new breeding units. However, many mathematical models for an Allee effect do not make a distinction between breeding group establishment and subsequent population growth. Our objective is to derive a spatially explicit mathematical model, where dispersers have a reduced probability of finding mates at low densities, and parameterize the model for wolf recolonization in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE). In this model, only the probability of establishing new breeding units is influenced by the reduced probability of finding mates at low densities. We analytically and numerically solve the model to determine the effect of a decreased probability in finding mates at low densities on population spread rate and density. Our results suggest that a reduced probability of finding mates at low densities may slow recolonization rate.},

@article{van_oijen_light_2004,
	Abstract = {The role of iron and light in controlling photosynthate production and allocation in phytoplankton populations of the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean was investigated in April-May 1999. The C-14 incorporation into five biochemical pools (glucan, amino acids, proteins, lipids and polysaccharides) was measured during iron/light perturbation experiments. The diurnal Chl a-specific rates of carbon incorporation into these pools did not change in response to iron addition, yet were decreased at 20 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1), an irradiance comparable with the one at 20-45 m in situ depth. This suggests that the low phytoplankton biomass encountered (0.1-0.6 mug Chl a L-1) was mainly caused by light limitation in the deep wind mixed layer ({\textgreater}40 m). Regional differences in Chl a-specific carbon incorporation rates were not found in spite of differences in phytoplankton species composition: at the Antarctic Polar Front, biomass was dominated by a diatom population of Fragilariopsis kerguelensis, whereas smaller cells, including chrysophytes, were relatively more abundant in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current beyond the influence of frontal systems. Because mixing was often in excess of 100 m in the latter region, diatom cells may have been unable to fulfil their characteristically high Fe demand at low average light conditions, and thus became co-limited by both resources. Using a model that describes the C-14 incorporation, the consistency was shown between the dynamics in the glucan pool in the field experiments and in laboratory experiments with an Antarctic diatom, Chaetoceros brevis. The glucan respiration rate was almost twice as high during the dark phase as during the light phase, which is consistent with the role of glucan as a reserve supplying energy and carbon skeletons for continued protein synthesis during the night.},

	Abstract = {Interspecific variation among wood density (WD), wood water content (WWC), tree mortality and diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) increment was examined for 27 tree species (from 13 families), based on a 9-year interval data obtained from a permanent 1-ha forest plot setup for long-term studies of tree dynamics in Kuala Belong rainforest, Brunei, on Borneo Island. The species were also categorized into three adult stature groups of understorey (maximum height {\textless}= 15-20 m tall, n = 14), midcanopy (maximum height, 20-30 m tall, n = 8) and canopy/emergent ({\textgreater} maximum height, {\textgreater} 30 m tall, n = 5) tree species. All measured traits varied appreciably among species. Tree WD varied between 0.3 and 0.8 g cm(-3), and exhibited the least coefficient of variation (14.7\%). D.b.h. increment was low, averaging 1.05 (95\% confidence limits: 0.57-2.13) mm year(-1) and was attributed to predominance of understorey species in the sampled plot. Overall, annual mortality was also low, averaging 2.73\% per year. The three adult stature groups differed significantly in d.b.h. increment and WWC but not in tree mortality and WD. Across species and especially more so when phylogenetic effect is minimized, WD was negatively related to tree mortality and d.b.h. increment, while a positive trend was observed between d.b.h. increment and tree mortality. A negative trend was also detected between maximum plant height and WWC, which was interpreted as a consequence of increased evaporative demand and use of xylem stored water by taller trees in order to compensate for hydraulic limitations to water transport induced by frictional resistance. No doubt, the traits chosen may vary spatially, but the consistent interspecific patterns observed in this study among coexisting species of differing adult stature reflect 'vertical' niche differentiation and may help to explain population regulation in a multispecies ecosystem like tropical rainforest.},

	Abstract = {In this study, key ecological modelling limitations of a process-based simulation model and a Bayesian network were reduced by combining the two approaches. We demonstrate the combined modelling approach with a case study investigating increases in woody vegetation density in northern Australia's tropical savannas. We found that by utilising the strengths of a simulation model and a Bayesian network we could both forecast future change in woody vegetation density and diagnose the reasons for current vegetation states. The local conditions of climate, soil characteristics and the starting population of trees were found to be more important in explaining the likelihood of change in woody vegetation density compared to management practices such as grazing pressure and fire regimes. We conclude that combining the strengths of a process and BN model allowed us to produce a simple model that utilised the ability of the process model to simulate ecosystem processes in detail and over long time periods, and the ability of the BN to capture uncertainty in ecosystem response and to conduct scenario, sensitivity and diagnostic analysis. The overall result was a model that has the potential to provide land managers with a better understanding of the behaviour of a complex ecosystem than simply utilising either modelling approach in isolation.

One remarkable feature resulting from such interactions is the immune system's ability to improve its capability to fight antigens commonly found in the individual's environment. This adaptation process is called the evolution of specificity. In this paper, we introduce a new mathematical model for the evolution of specificity in humoral immunity, based on Jerne's functional, or idiotypic, network. The evolution of specificity is modeled as the dynamic Updating of connection weights in a dynamic graph whose nodes are related to the network's idiotypes. At the core of this weight-updating mechanism are the increase in specificity caused by clonal selection and the decrease in specificity due to the insertion of uncorrelated idiotypes by the bone marrow. As we demonstrate through numerous Computer experiments, for appropriate choices of parameters the new model correctly reproduces, in qualitative terms, several immune functions.

Using projections of species' distributions for future climate scenarios, we assess extinction risks for sample regions that cover some 20\% of the Earth's terrestrial surface. Exploring three approaches in which the estimated probability of extinction shows a powerlaw relationship with geographical range size, we predict, on the basis of mid-range climate-warming scenarios for 2050, that 15 - 37\% of species in our sample of regions and taxa will be 'committed to extinction'. When the average of the three methods and two dispersal scenarios is taken, minimal climate-warming scenarios produce lower projections of species committed to extinction (similar to18\%) than mid-range (similar to24\%) and maximum-change (similar to35\%) scenarios. These estimates show the importance of rapid implementation of technologies to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and strategies for carbon sequestration.},

@article{coley_possible_1998,
	Abstract = {The interactions between plants and herbivores are key determinants of community structure world wide. Their role is particularly important in lowland tropical rain forests where rates of herbivory are higher, plants are better defended chemically and physically, and herbivores have specialized diets. In contrast to the temperate zone, most of the herbivory in the tropics occurs on ephemeral young leaves ({\textgreater}70\%), which requires herbivores to have finely tuned host-finding abilities. As a consequence of these tight ecological and evolutionary linkages, the interplay between plants and herbivores in the tropics may be more susceptible to perturbations of climate change. Increases in global temperature, atmospheric CO2, and the length of the dry season are all likely to have ramifications for plant/herbivore interactions in the tropics. Here I extrapolate from our current and incomplete understanding of the mechanisms regulating plant/herbivore interactions and present a scenario for possible trends under a changing climate. Although elevated CO2 tends to enhance plant growth rates, the larger effects of increased drought stress will probably result in lower growth. In atmospheres experimentally enriched in CO2, the nutritional quality of leaves declines substantially due to a dilution of nitrogen by 10-30\%. This response is buffered in plant species associated with nitrogen fixers. Elevated CO2 should also cause a slight decrease in nitrogen-based defenses(e.g., alkaloids) and a slight increase in carbon-based defenses (e.g., tannins). The most dramatic and robust predicted effect of climate change is on rates of herbivory. Lower foliar nitrogen due to CO2 fertilization of plants causes an increase in consumption per herbivore by as much as 40\% and unusually severe drought appears to cause herbivore populations to explode. In areas where elevated CO2 is combined with drying, rates of herbivory may rise 2-4 fold. The frequency of insect outbreaks is also expected to increase. Higher herbivory should further reduce plant growth rates, perhaps favoring plant species that are well-defended or fix nitrogen. The predicted increase in the number of herbivores is primarily due to relaxed pressure from predators and parasitoids. Elevated temperatures may increase herbivore developmental times, affording them partial escape from discovery by natural enemies, and drought appears to decimate parasitoid populations. The expected decline in parasitoid numbers may be due to direct effects of dry season drought or to the relative scarcity of herbivores during that period. As a consequence, the relative abundance of species will change, and overall biodiversity should decline.},

Moreover, we discuss the connection between the time interval of the discrete-time dynamic model and the ability of the plant to rebuild completely its vegetative body (from reserves).

@article{cumming_elephants_1997-1,
	Abstract = {When elephant densities exceed approximately 0.5 per km(2), savanna woodlands are generally converted to shrublands oi grasslands. The impact of such elephant-mediated habitat change on biodiversity in African game reserves has seldom been measured. We examined species richness of woody plants, birds, bats, mantises and ants in reserves where elephants had destroyed the miombo woodland and in adjacent but intact miombo woodlands outside the reserves. Species richness of woodland birds and ants was significantly lower where elephants had removed the tree canopy. Our findings may have important policy implications for conserving biodiversity in many African reserves in the face of rapidly growing elephant populations (approximately 5\% per annum). The problem is further compounded by international public pressures against reducing elephant densities within game reserves while, outside these protected areas, savanna woodlands and their associated faunas are being lost to agriculture. Where then will refugia for habitat-sensitive species exist if not within the region's largest protected areas?},

These maps are linear for negative values of the parameter and non-linear for positive values of the parameter. Both C-1 and C-2 maps of this form are considered. These maps display both period-adding and period-doubling behaviour. For maps with a squared or 3/2 term the stability and existence conditions of fixed points and period-2 orbits in the vicinity of the border-collision are found analytically. These agree with the Feigin classification proposed by di Bernardo et al. [Chaos Solitons and Fractals 10 (1999) 188 1]. The period-adding behaviour is examined in these maps, where analytical solutions for the boundaries of periodic solutions are found. Implicit equations for the boundaries of periodic windows for varying power term are also found and plotted. Thus, it is proved that period-adding scenarios are generic in maps of this form.

	Abstract = {It has long been recognized that gradual secular changes in environmental parameters may lead to discontinuous changes in ecosystems. The dominant model ex plaining such changes has been the presence of alternative attractors and their basins. We discuss a related model, that of basin boundary collisions, that may also produce discontinuous changes in an environmental variable. The alternative model suggests that the underlying structure of the basins themselves may be gradually changed by the changing environmental factor. Consequently, the basin of the chaotic attractor may disappear, because it intersects the alternative basin; hence the term basin boundary collision. The implications of this model can be dramatic, such as sudden and unpredictable extinctions or dramatic and unexpected changes in ecosystem syndromes. Furthermore, where this model applies, ancillary phenomena such as a lag in time of the ecosystem change or the existence of so-called chaotic transients may be important. Also discussed are the implications of these results in a world in which slowly changing forcing parameters are well known (e.g., gradual increases of CO2 in the atmosphere, and gradual changes in political attitudes about conservation).},

@article{raddatz_will_2007,
	Abstract = {Global warming caused by anthropogenic CO2 emissions is expected to reduce the capability of the ocean and the land biosphere to take up carbon. This will enlarge the fraction of the CO2 emissions remaining in the atmosphere, which in turn will reinforce future climate change. Recent model studies agree in the existence of such a positive climate-carbon cycle feedback, but the estimates of its amplitude differ by an order of magnitude, which considerably increases the uncertainty in future climate projections. Therefore we discuss, in how far a particular process or component of the carbon cycle can be identified, that potentially contributes most to the positive feedback. The discussion is based on simulations with a carbon cycle model, which is embedded in the atmosphere/ocean general circulation model ECHAM5/MPI-OM. Two simulations covering the period 1860-2100 are conducted to determine the impact of global warming on the carbon cycle. Forced by historical and future carbon dioxide emissions (following the scenario A2 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), they reveal a noticeable positive climate-carbon cycle feedback, which is mainly driven by the tropical land biosphere. The oceans contribute much less to the positive feedback and the temperate/boreal terrestrial biosphere induces a minor negative feedback. The contrasting behavior of the tropical and temperate/boreal land biosphere is mostly attributed to opposite trends in their net primary productivity (NPP) under global warming conditions. As these findings depend on the model employed they are compared with results derived from other climate-carbon cycle models, which participated in the Coupled Climate-Carbon Cycle Model Intercomparison Project (C4MIP).},

@article{humphries_effect_1999,
	Abstract = {Recent influential models of the distribution of foraging animals have recognised the importance of individual variation in competitive ability, but have assumed that this property is intrinsic to the individual. However, Tregenza et al. suggested that in continuous input situations (where resources are supplied at a steady rate and utilised immediately) the relative competitive ability of an individual may be affected by competitor density. We therefore examined the effect of group size (which was equivalent to competitor density) on relative competitive abilities within a shoal of European minnows (Phoxinus phoxinus) exploiting a single, continuous-input food patch. In partial agreement with Tregenza et al. and in contrast to Sutherland and Parker's 'Phenotype scales intercept' model of the ideal free distribution (IFD) with competitive asymmetries, we found two processes which act in opposite directions. These effects can cancel each other out to give the misleading idea that there is no effect of group size upon relative competitive ability. These effects were dependent upon the difference in body size between the two fish in a pair, but this difference itself had no direct effect on relative competitive ability. The reasons for the differences between our results and those of Tregenza et al. are discussed.},

@article{seidl_individual-based_2012,
	Abstract = {Forest ecosystem dynamics emerges from nonlinear interactions between adaptive biotic agents (i.e., individual trees) and their relationship with a spatially and temporally heterogeneous abiotic environment. Understanding and predicting the dynamics resulting from these complex interactions is crucial for the sustainable stewardship of ecosystems, particularly in the context of rapidly changing environmental conditions. Here we present iLand (the individual-based forest landscape and disturbance model), a novel approach to simulating forest dynamics as an emergent property of environmental drivers, ecosystem processes and dynamic interactions across scales. Our specific objectives were (i) to describe the model, in particular its novel approach to simulate spatially explicit individual-tree competition for resources over large scales within a process-based framework of physiological resource use, and (ii) to present a suite of evaluation experiments assessing iLands ability to simulate tree growth and mortality for a wide range of forest ecosystems. Adopting an approach rooted in ecological field theory, iLand calculates a continuous field of light availability over the landscape, with every tree represented by a mechanistically derived, size- and species-dependent pattern of light interference. Within a hierarchical multi-scale framework productivity is derived at stand-level by means of a light-use efficiency approach, and downscaled to individuals via local light availability. Allocation (based on allometric ratios) and mortality (resulting from carbon starvation) are modeled at the individual-tree level, accounting for adaptive behavior of trees in response to their environment. To evaluate the model we conducted simulations over the extended environmental gradient of a longitudinal transect in Oregon, USA, and successfully compared results against independently observed productivity estimates (63.4\% of variation explained) and mortality patterns in even-aged stands. This transect experiment was furthermore replicated for a different set of species and ecosystems in the Austrian Alps, documenting the robustness and generality of our approach. Model performance was also successfully evaluated for structurally and compositionally complex old-growth forests in the western Cascades of Oregon. Finally, the ability of our approach to address forest ecosystem dynamics at landscape scales was demonstrated by a computational scaling experiment. In simulating the emergence of ecosystem patterns and dynamics as a result of complex process interactions across scales our approach has the potential to contribute crucial capacities to understanding and fostering forest ecosystem resilience under changing climatic conditions. 2012 Elsevier B.V.

@article{schenk_mapping_2005,
	Abstract = {Global data sets of rooting depths, long-term means of monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, and soil texture were used to predict the probability of deep rooting around the globe. Rooting depths were considered to be deep if 5\% or more of all roots in a profile were located below 2 in depth. Spatially explicit global predictions were based on empirical models relating the probability of deep rooting with climate and soil texture. Based on these predictions, deep roots are most likely to occur in seasonally dry, semiarid to humid tropical regions under savanna or thorn-scrub vegetation or under seasonally dry semideciduous to evergreen forests. Deep roots are least likely to occur in arctic, boreal or cool-temperate regions and in per-humid climates such as equatorial rain forests. Under warm-temperate to tropical climates, rooting depths are more likely to be deep in coarse-textured and fine-textured soil than in soils of medium texture. These observations agree well with predictions based on a previously published conceptual model, according to which water infiltration depths and evaporative demand are the main climatic factors to determine vertical root distributions on a global scale.

	Abstract = {Reports of the 13C content of marine particulate organic carbon are compiled and on the basis of GEOSECS data and temperatures, concentrations, and isotopic compositions of dissolved CO2 in the waters in which the related phytoplankton grew are estimated. In this way, the fractionation of carbon isotopes during photosynthetic fixation of CO2 is found to be significantly correlated with concentrations of dissolved CO2. Because ancient carbon isotopic fractionations have been determined from analyses of sedimentary porphyrins [Popp et al., 1989], the relationship between isotopic fractionation and concentrations of dissolved CO2 developed here can be employed to estimate concentrations of CO2 dissolved in ancient oceans and, in turn, partial pressures of CO2 in ancient atmospheres. The calculations take into account the temperature dependence of chemical and isotopic equilibria in the dissolved-inorganic-carbon system and of air-sea equilibria. Paleoenvironmental temperatures for each sample are estimated from reconstructions of paleogeography, latitudinal temperature gradients, and secular changes in low-latitude sea surface temperature. It is estimated that atmospheric partial pressures of CO2 were over 1000 micro atm 160 - 100 Ma ago, then declined to values near 300 micro atm during the next 100 Ma. Analysis of a high-resolution record of carbon isotopic fractionation at the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary suggests that the partial pressure of CO2 in the atmosphere was drawn down from values near 840 micro atm to values near 700 micro atm during the anoxic event.},

	Abstract = {Among the most pronounced large-scale geographic patterns of plant biodiversity are the increase in plant species richness towards the tropics, a more even distribution of the relative abundances of plant species in the tropics, and a nearly log-normal relative abundance distribution. Here we use an individual-based plant diversity model that relates climatic constraints to feasible plant growth strategies to show that all three basic diversity patterns can be predicted merely from the climatic constraints acting upon plant ecophysiological trade-offs. Our model predicts that towards objectively 'harsher' environments, the range of feasible growth strategies resulting in reproductive plants is reduced, thus resulting in lower functional plant species richness. The reduction of evenness is attributed to a more rapid decline in productivity from the most productive to less productive plant growth strategies since the particular setup of the strategy becomes more important in maintaining high productivity in harsher environments. This approach is also able to reproduce the increase in the deviation from a log-normal distribution towards more evenly distributed communities of the tropics. Our results imply that these general biodiversity relationships can be understood primarily by considering the climatic constraints on plant ecophysiological trade-offs.},

@article{ryerson_vegetation_2001,
	Abstract = {Responses of plant communities to mammalian herbivores vary widely, due to variation in plant species; composition, herbivore densities, forage preferences, soils, and climate. In this study, we evaluated vegetation changes on 30 sites within and adjacent to the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge (SNWR) in central New Mexico, USA, over a 20-yr period following removal of the major herbivores (livestock and prairie dogs) in 1972-1975. The study sites were established in 1976, and were resampled in 1986 and 1996 using line transect methods. At the landscape scale, repeated measures ANOVA of percentage cover measurements showed no significant overall net changes in total perennial plant basal cover, either with or without herbivores present; however, there was an overall increase in annual forbs and plant litter from 1976 to 1996. At the site scale, significant changes in species composition and dominance were observed both through time and across the SNWR boundary. Site histories varied widely, with sites dominated by Bouteloua eriopoda being the most dynamic and sites dominated by Scleropogon brevifolius being the most persistent. Species-specific changes also were observed across multiple sites: B. eriopoda cover increased while Gutierrezia sarothrae greatly decreased. The non-uniform, multi-directional changes of the sites' vegetation acted to prevent detection of overall changes in perennial vegetation at the landscape level. Some sites displayed significant changes after removal of herbivores, while others appeared to respond primarily to climate dynamics. Certain species that were not preferred by livestock or prairie dogs, showed overall declines during drought periods, while other preferred species exhibited wide-spread increases during wetter periods regardless of herbivore presence. Therefore, the vegetation dynamics cannot be attributed solely to removal of herbivores, and in some cases can be explained by short- and long-term fluctuations in climate. These results emphasize the variety of responses of sites with differences in vegetation to mammalian herbivores under otherwise similar climatic conditions, and illustrate the value of site- and landscape-scale approaches to understanding the impacts of plant-herbivore interactions.},

@article{keeley_evolution_2003,
	Abstract = {Mechanisms for concentrating carbon around the Rubisco enzyme, which drives the carbon-reducing steps in photosynthesis, are widespread in plants; in vascular plants they are known as crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) and C 4 photosynthesis. CAM is common in desert succulents, tropical epiphytes, and aquatic plants and is characterized by nighttime fixation of CO(2). The proximal selective factor driving the evolution of this CO(2)-concentrating pathway is low daytime CO(2), which results from the unusual reverse stomatal behavior of terrestrial CAM species or from patterns of ambient CO(2) availability for aquatic CAM species. In terrestrials the ultimate selective factor is water stress that has selected for increased water use efficiency. In aquatics the ultimate selective factor is diel fluctuations in CO(2) availability for palustrine species and extreme oligotrophic conditions for lacustrine species. C(4) photosynthesis is based on similar biochemistry but carboxylation steps are spatially separated in the leaf rather than temporally as in CAM. This biochemical pathway is most commonly associated with a specialized leaf anatomy known as Kranz anatomy; however, there are exceptions. The ultimate selective factor driving the evolution of this pathway is excessively high photorespiration that inhibits normal C(3) photosynthesis under high light and high temperature in both terrestrial and aquatic habitats. CAM is an ancient pathway that likely has been present since the Paleozoic era in aquatic species from shallow-water palustrine habitats. While atmospheric CO(2) levels have undoubtedly affected the evolution of terrestrial plant carbon-concentrating mechanisms, there is reason to believe that past atmospheric changes have not played as important a selective role in the aquatic milieu since palustrine habitats today are not generally carbon sinks, and the selective factors driving aquatic CAM are autogenic. Terrestrial CAM, in contrast, is of increasing selective value under extreme water deficits, and undoubtedly, high Mesozoic CO(2) levels reduced the amount of landscape perceived by plants as water limited. Late Tertiary and Quaternary reductions in atmospheric CO(2), coupled with increasing seasonality, were probably times of substantial species radiation and ecological expansion for CAM plants. C(4) photosynthesis occurs in only about half as many families as CAM, and three-fourths of C(4) species are either grasses or sedges. Molecular phylogenies indicate C(4) is a more recent innovation than CAM and that it originated in the mid-Tertiary,20-30 Ma, although some data support an earlier origin. While the timing of the origin of C(4) remains controversial, the nearly explosive increase in C(4) species is clearly documented in the late Miocene, 4-7 Ma. Increasing seasonality has been widely suggested as an important climatic stimulus for this C(4) expansion. Alternatively, based on models of photosynthetic quantum yield at different temperatures and CO(2) concentration, it has been hypothesized that the late Miocene C(4) expansion resulted from declining atmospheric CO(2) levels. This model is most appropriate for explaining the transition from C(3) grasslands to C(4) grasslands but by itself may not be sufficient to explain the more likely scenario of a late Miocene transition from C(3) woodland/savanna to C(4) grasslands. A largely unexplored hypothesis is that climatic changes in late Miocene altered disturbance regimes, in particular the incidence of fires, which today are often associated with maintenance of C(4) grasslands. Oceanic charcoal sediments that appear to represent Aeolian deposits from continental wildfires follow a strikingly similar pattern of explosive increase in late Miocene. Climate, CO(2), and disturbance are not mutually exclusive explanations and probably all acted in concert to promote the expansion of C(4) grasslands. More recently, late Quaternary changes in CO(2) may have been responsible for driving major changes in the landscape distribution of C(4) species. The theory is sound; however, many of the studies cited in support of this model are open to alternative interpretations, and none has eliminated climatic factors as important selective agents. CAM and C(4) evolution required coupling of biochemical pathways with structural changes in photosynthetic tissues, succulence in CAM and Kranz in C(4). This was apparently accomplished by piecemeal evolution beginning with mechanisms for recapturing respiratory CO(2), although this need not have been so in aquatic CAM species. It has been proposed that the extreme rarity of both pathways in the same plant results from biochemical and structural incompatibilities (Sage 2002). Equally important is the fact that the selective environments are quite different, with CAM evolution thriving on stressful sites inhospitable to C(3) species whereas C(4) evolution has selected for rapid growth capable of outcompeting associated C(3) plants.},

An alternative method of calculating sequestration rates from consideration of water use and carbon-isotope discrimination data had a close to 1 : 1 match with estimates from allometric relationships. We developed and applied algorithms to predict the impacts of. re on carbon stocks of live trees.

	Abstract = {In this study, the influence of elevated carbon dioxide (CO,) and nitrogen (N) deposition on gastropod herbivory was investigated for six annual species in a California annual grassland community. These experimentally simulated global changes increased availability of important resources for plant growth, leading to the hypothesis that species with the most positive growth and foliar nutrient responses would experience the greatest increase in herbivory. Counter to the expectations, shifts in tissue N and growth rates caused by N deposition did not predict shifts in herbivore consumption rates. N deposition increased seedling N concentrations and growth rates but did not increase herbivore consumption overall, or for any individual species. Elevated CO, did not influence growth rates nor have a statistically significant influence oil seedling N concentrations. Elevated CO, at ambient N levels caused a decline in the number of seedlings consumed, but the interaction between CO, and N addition differed among species. The results of this study indicate that shifting patterns of herbivory will likely influence species composition as environmental conditions change in the future; however a simple trade-off between shifting growth rates and palatability is not evident.},

	Abstract = {During a five-year GPS satellite tracking study in Sabi Sand Reserve (SSR) and Kruger National Park (KNP) we monitored the daily movements of an elephant cow (Loxodonta africana) from September 2003 to August 2008. The study animal was confirmed to be part of a group of seven elephants therefore her position is representative of the matriarchal group. We found that the study animal did not use habitat randomly and confirmed strong seasonal fidelity to its summer and winter five-year home ranges. The cow's summer home range was in KNP in an area more than four times that of her SSR winter home range. She exhibited clear park habitation with up to three visits per year travelling via a well-defined northern or southern corridor. There was a positive correlation between the daily distance the elephant walked and minimum daily temperature and the elephant was significantly closer to rivers and artificial waterholes than would be expected if it were moving randomly in KNP and SSR. Transect lines established through the home ranges were surveyed to further understand the fine scale of the landscape and vegetation representative of the home ranges.},

	Abstract = {Background Modelling plant growth allows us to test hypotheses and carry out virtual experiments concerning plant growth processes that could otherwise take years in field conditions. The visualization of growth simulations allows us to see directly and vividly the outcome of a given model and provides us with an instructive tool useful for agronomists and foresters, as well as for teaching. Functional-structural (FS) plant growth models are nowadays particularly important for integrating biological processes with environmental conditions in 3-D virtual plants, and provide the basis for more advanced research in plant sciences. Scope In this viewpoint paper, we ask the following questions. Are we modelling the correct processes that drive plant growth, and is growth driven mostly by sink or source activity? In current models, is the importance of soil resources (nutrients, water, temperature and their interaction with meristematic activity) considered adequately? Do classic models account for architectural adjustment as well as integrating the fundamental principles of development? Whilst answering these questions with the available data in the literature, we put forward the opinion that plant architecture and sink activity must be pushed to the centre of plant growth models. In natural conditions, sinks will more often drive growth than source activity, because sink activity is often controlled by finite soil resources or developmental constraints. PMA06 This viewpoint paper also serves as an introduction to this Special Issue devoted to plant growth modelling, which includes new research covering areas stretching from cell growth to biomechanics. All papers were presented at the Second International Symposium on Plant Growth Modeling, Simulation, Visualization and Applications (PMA06), held in Beijing, China, from 13-17 November, 2006. Although a large number of papers are devoted to FS models of agricultural and forest crop species, physiological and genetic processes have recently been included and point the way to a new direction in plant modelling research.},

	Abstract = {Occasionally, surprisingly large shifts occur in ecosystems. Theory suggests that such shifts can be attributed to alternative stable states. Verifying this diagnosis is important because it implies a radically different view on management options, and on the potential effects of global change on such ecosystems. For instance, it implies that gradual changes in temperature or other factors might have little effect until a threshold is reached at which a large shift occurs that might be difficult to reverse. Strategies to assess whether alternative stable states are present are now converging in fields as disparate as desertification, limnology, oceanography and climatology. Here, we review emerging ways to link theory to observation, and conclude that although, field observations can provide hints of alternative stable states, experiments and models are essential for a good diagnosis.},

	Abstract = {The effects that below-freezing temperature (frost) can have at times of year when it is unusual are an interesting ecological phenomenon that has received little attention. The physiological consequence of formation of ice crystals in plant tissue is often death of the plants, or at least of sensitive parts that can include flower buds, ovaries, and leaves. The loss of potential for sexual reproduction can have long-lasting effects on the demography of annuals and long-lived perennials, because the short-term negative effects of frosts can result in longer-term benefits through lowered populations of seed predators. The loss of host plants can have dramatic consequences for herbivores, even causing local extinctions, and the loss of just flowers can also affect populations of seed predators and their parasitoids. Frosts can cause local extinctions and influence the geographical distribution of some species. The potential for global climate change to influence the frequency and distribution of frost events is uncertain, but it seems likely that they may become more frequent in some areas and less frequent in others.},

@article{carbone_feeding_1997,
	Abstract = {1. Group hunting in social carnivores is generally thought to have evolved through natural selection for improved efficiency of prey capture, increased prey size apprehended or defence of the kill against intra- and interspecific kleptoparasitism. 2. We used a simple model to explore how variation in hunting group size of wild dogs in the Serengeti influences defence of kills against kleptoparasitism from spotted hyenas and the trade-off effects this has on intake rate per dog for a given prey size selected. 3. The analysis presented suggests that while kleptoparasitism substantially influences the amount of time a hunting group can access a kill, increases in access time with increased hunting group size rarely fully compensate for the reduction in each dog's share of the carcass due to scramble competition among the dogs. 4. A profitability index, which includes limitations of the probability of capturing different sized prey, gut capacity, food depletion and access time, suggests that small hunting groups (1-2) would be particularly vulnerable to kleptoparasitism because they are unable to fully satiate themselves before spotted hyenas take over their kills. Intermediate-sized hunting groups may be most effective at meeting nutritional demands over a range of prey sizes. 5. While reasons for the recent extinction of the Serengeti wild dog population remain speculative, this paper contributes to the debate by proposing that kleptoparasitism by spotted hyenas would have placed a major constraint on the ability of individual wild dog packs to recover from episodic disasters.},

@article{falster_influence_2011,
	Abstract = {1. Numerous plant traits are known to influence aspects of individual performance, including rates of carbon uptake, tissue turnover, mortality and fecundity. These traits are bound to influence emergent properties of vegetation because quantities such as leaf-area cover, average height, primary productivity and density of standing biomass result from the collective behaviour of individuals. Yet, little is known about the influence of individual traits on these emergent properties, despite the widespread use in current vegetation models of plant functional types, each of which is defined by a constellation of traits.2. We examine the influence of four key traits (leaf economic strategy, height at maturation, wood density, and seed size) on four emergent vegetation properties (average height of leaf area, leaf-area index, net primary productivity and biomass density). We employ a trait-, size- and patch-structured model of vegetation dynamics that allows scaling up from individual-level growth processes and probabilistic disturbances to landscape-level predictions. A physiological growth model incorporating relevant trade-offs was designed and calibrated based on known empirical patterns. The resulting vegetation model naturally exhibits a range of phenomena commonly observed in vegetation dynamics.3. We modelled single-species stands, varying each trait over its known empirical range. Seed size had only a small effect on vegetation properties, primarily because our metapopulations were not seed-limited. The remaining traits all had larger effects on vegetation properties, especially on biomass density. Leaf economic strategy influenced minimum light requirement, and thus total leaf area and basal area. Wood density and height at maturation influenced vegetation mainly by modifying individual stem mass. These effects of traits were maintained, and sometimes amplified, across stands differing in productivity and mean disturbance interval.4. Synthesis: Natural trait variation can cause large differences in emergent properties of vegetation, the magnitudes of which approach those arising through changes to site productivity and disturbance frequency. Our results therefore underscore the need for next-generation vegetation models that incorporate functional traits together with their effects on the patch and size structure of vegetation.},

@article{taylor_drought_2011,
	Abstract = {Phylogenetic analyses show that C(4) grasses typically occupy drier habitats than their C(3) relatives, but recent experiments comparing the physiology of closely related C(3) and C(4) species have shown that advantages of C(4) photosynthesis can be lost under drought. We tested the generality of these paradoxical findings in grass species representing the known evolutionary diversity of C(4) NADP-me and C(3) photosynthetic types. Our experiment investigated the effects of drought on leaf photosynthesis, water potential, nitrogen, chlorophyll content and mortality. C(4) grasses in control treatments were characterized by higher CO(2) assimilation rates and water potential, but lower stomatal conductance and nitrogen content. Under drought, stomatal conductance declined more dramatically in C(3) than C(4) species, and photosynthetic water-use and nitrogen-use efficiency advantages held by C(4) species under control conditions were each diminished by 40\%. Leaf mortality was slightly higher in C(4) than C(3) grasses, but leaf condition under drought otherwise showed no dependence on photosynthetic-type. This phylogenetically controlled experiment suggested that a drought-induced reduction in the photosynthetic performance advantages of C(4) NADP-me relative to C(3) grasses is a general phenomenon.},

@article{weng_scaling_2014,
	Abstract = {The long-term and large scale dynamics of ecosystems are in large part determined by the performances of individual plants in competition with one another for light, water and nutrients. Woody biomass, a pool of carbon (C) larger than 50\% of atmospheric CO2, exists because of height-structured competition for light. However, most of the current Earth System Models that predict climate change and C cycle feedbacks lack both a mechanistic formulation for height-structured competition for light and an explicit scaling from individual plants to the globe. In this study, we incorporate height-structured competition and explicit scaling from individuals to ecosystems into the land model (LM3) currently used in the Earth System Models developed by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL). The height-structured formulation is based on the Perfect Plasticity Approximation (PPA), which has been shown to accurately scale from individual-level plant competition for light, water and nutrients to the dynamics of whole communities. Because of the tractability of the PPA, the coupled LM3--PPA model is able to include a large number of phenomena across a range of spatial and temporal scales, and still retain computational tractability, as well as close linkages to mathematically tractable forms of the model. We test a range of predictions against data from temperate broadleaved forests in the northern USA. The results show the model predictions agree with diurnal and annual C fluxes, growth rates of individual trees in the canopy and understory, tree size distributions, and species-level population dynamics during succession. We also show how the competitively optimal allocation strategy -- the strategy that can competitively exclude all others -- shifts as a function of the atmospheric CO2 concentration. This strategy is referred as an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) in the ecological literature and is typically not the same as a productivity- or growth-maximizing strategy. Model simulations predict that C sinks caused by CO2 fertilization in forests limited by light and water will be down-regulated if allocation tracks changes in the competitive optimum. The implementation of the model in this paper is for temperate broadleaved forest trees, but the formulation of the model is general. It can be expanded to include other growth forms and physiologies simply by altering parameter values.},

@article{schutz_juggling_2009,
	Abstract = {In frequently burnt mesic savannas, trees can get trapped into a cycle of surviving fire-induced stem death (i.e. topkill) by resprouting, only to be topkilled again a year or two later. The ability of savanna saplings to resprout repeatedly after fire is a key component of recent models of tree--grass coexistence in savannas. This study investigated the carbon allocation and biomass partitioning patterns that enable a dominant savanna tree, Acacia karroo , to survive frequent and repeated topkill. Root starch depletion and replenishment, foliage recovery and photosynthesis of burnt and unburnt plants were compared over the first year after a burn. The concentration of starch in the roots of the burnt plants (0.08 $\pm$ 0.01 g g −1 ) was half that of the unburnt plant (0.16 $\pm$ 0.01 g g −1 ) at the end of the first growing season after topkill. However, root starch reserves of the burnt plants were replenished over the dry season and matched that of unburnt plants within 1 year after topkill. The leaf area of resprouting plants recovered to match that of unburnt plants within 4--5 months after topkill. Shoot growth of resprouting plants was restricted to the first few months of the wet season, whereas photosynthetic rates remained high into the dry season, allowing replenishment of root starch reserves. 14 C labeling showed that reserves were initially utilized for shoot growth after topkill. The rapid foliage recovery and the replenishment of reserves within a single year after topkill implies that A. karroo is well adapted to survive recurrent topkill and is poised to take advantage of unusually long fire-free intervals to grow into adults. This paper provides some of the first empirical evidence to explain how savanna trees in frequently burnt savannas are able to withstand frequent burning as juveniles and survive to become adults.},

@article{caughley_elephant_1976,
	Abstract = {Published hypotheses to account for habitat changes wrought by elephants begin from the assumption that elephant-forest systems possess a stable equilibrium point. The �elephant problem� is conceived as a displacement of this equilibrium by man. Controversy centres around which human activities caused the dislocation of equilibrium and by which mechanisms these activities resulted in local high densities of the elephant Loxodonta africana. A study on elephant-forest relationships in the Luangwa Valley of Zambia casts doubt upon the basic assumption of these hypotheses and an alternative hypothesis is therefore offered. It begins from the opposite assumption�that there is no attainable natural equilibrium between elephants and forests in eastern and southern Africa. The relationship is viewed instead as a stable limit cycle in which elephants increase while thinning the forest and decline until reaching a low density that allows resurgence of the forest. This in turn triggers an increase of elephants and the cycle repeats. The period of the cycle, if the hypothesis is correct, is in the order of 200 years in the Luangwa Valley. The activities of man can impose an artificial equilibrium on the system such that trees and elephants are trapped at the low density phase of the cycle. When interference is relaxed, as with the conversion of an area to a national park, the cyclic relationship reasserts. The parameters of a system possessing a stable limit cycle need not differ in kind or interrelationship from those of a system with a stable equilibrium. Whether one or other outcome manifests may depend only on the numerical values of the parameters. If the elephant-forest system is characterized by a stable limit cycle the period and amplitude should change along a climatic gradient and may contract to a stable equilibrium in some climatic zones. A set of predictions is offered to facilitate rejection of the hypothesis.},

	Abstract = {Six white fir trials were established during the last half-century to develop guidelines for managing the existing natural stands across northeastern California. We analyzed data collected from these trials at about 5-year intervals since their installation. Because these trials were independent of each other, the design and treatments varied among the sites. Targeted density treatments were selected based on 40, 55, and 70\% of normal basal area from early yield tables at three of the sites. More density treatments were included at the remaining three sites. We found a significant response in growth to different stand densities regardless of site qualities, ages, and stand histories. Periodic annual increment for basal area and volume varied significantly by periods for all sites except the basal area at one site. Regardless of site quality, thinning from below leaving about 64\% of the original measure of basal area did not significantly reduce productivity. If performed early in the life of the stand, such a thinning will reduce the accumulation of flammable materials due to natural self-thinning. A logistic function of periodic annual increment for basal area to relative stand density fits the data well and can be a useful tool for forest manager.},

Here, combining extensive sea and land surface temperature reconstructions from the Last Glacial Maximum with climate model simulations, we estimate a lower median (2.3 K) and reduced uncertainty (1.7 to 2.6 K as the 66\% probability range, which can be widened using alternate assumptions or data subsets). Assuming that paleoclimatic constraints apply to the future, as predicted by our model, these results imply a lower probability of imminent extreme climatic change than previously thought.},

@article{kleidon_multiple_2007,
	Abstract = {Multiple steady states in the atmosphere-biosphere system can arise as a consequence of interactions and positive feedbacks. While atmospheric conditions affect vegetation productivity in terms of available light, water, and heat, different levels of vegetation productivity can result in differing energy- and water partitioning at the land surface, thereby leading to different atmospheric conditions. Here we investigate the emergence of multiple steady states in the terrestrial atmosphere-biosphere system and focus on the role of how vegetation is represented in the model: (i) in terms of a few, discrete vegetation classes, or (ii) a continuous representation. We then conduct sensitivity simulations with respect to initial conditions and to the number of discrete vegetation classes in order to investigate the emergence of multiple steady states. We find that multiple steady states occur in our model only if vegetation is represented by a few vegetation classes. With an increased number of classes, the difference between the number of multiple steady states diminishes, and disappears completely in our model when vegetation is represented by 8 classes or more. Despite the convergence of the multiple steady states into a single one, the resulting climate-vegetation state is nevertheless less productive when compared to the emerging state associated with the continuous vegetation parameterization. We conclude from these results that the representation of vegetation in terms of a few, discrete vegetation classes can result (a) in an artificial emergence of multiple steady states and (b) in a underestimation of vegetation productivity. Both of these aspects are important limitations to be considered when global vegetation-atmosphere models are to be applied to topics of global change.},

	Abstract = {We tested a variety of methods for determining steady state solutions for Biome-BGC, a coupled model of terrestrial water, carbon, and nitrogen dynamics. Our objective was to identify methods that could reduce the computational cost of model spin-up relative to simulations running under the model's native dynamics, while retaining or improving upon the simulation quality, where quality is judged by comparison to assumed values for the true steady state solution. Two classes of methods were tested: ad hoc methods that approximate steady state by taking advantage of specific characteristics of the modeled dynamics to produce individual time trajectories through the model state space, and general multivariate minimization methods that iteratively explore multiple time trajectories through state space in search of a reasonable steady state solution. We examined the behavior of these methods for both woody and herbaceous vegetation simulations. We found that both the ad hoc and the generalized methods, parameterized appropriately, could provide reductions in computational cost of 50-75\% compared to the model's native dynamics. With the exception of the generalized methods for the woody vegetation case, we also found that the quality of the simulated steady state solution was as good as or better than the native dynamics approach. The one method which performed consistently well across sites and vegetation types involved an acceleration of decomposition rates for the spin-up phase, resulting in 73 and 66\% reductions in computational cost for woody and herbaceous vegetation types, respectively.

@article{fuhlendorf_herbaceous_2001,
	Abstract = {A 44-yr record of herbaceous vegetation change was analysed for three contrasting grazing regimes within a semi-arid savanna to evaluate the relative contribution of confined livestock grazing and climatic variability as agents of vegetation change. Grazing intensity had a significant, directional effect on the relative composition of short- and mid-grass response groups; their composition was significantly correlated with time since the grazing regimes were established. Interannual precipitation was not significantly correlated with response group composition. However, interannual precipitation was significantly correlated with total plant basal area while time since imposition of grazing regimes was not, L but both interannual precipitation and tit-no since the grazing regimes were established were significantly correlated with total plant density. Vegetation change was reversible even though the herbaceous community had been maintained in an altered state for ca. 60 yr by intensive livestock grazing. However, ca, 25 yr were required for the mid-grass response group to recover following the elimination of grazing and recovery occurred intermittently. The increase in mid-grass composition was associated with a significant decrease in total plant density and an increase in mean individual plant basal area. Therefore, we failed to reject the hypotheses based on the proportional change in relative response group composition with grazing intensity and the distinct effects of grazing and climatic variability on response group composition, total basal area and plant density. Long-term vegetation change indicates that grazing intensity established the long-term directional change in response group composition, but that episodic climate events defined the short-term rate and trajectory of this change and determines the upper limit on total basal area. The occurrence of both directional and non-directional vegetation responses were largely a function of (1) the unique responses of the various community attributes monitored and (2) the distinct temporal responses of those community attributes to grazing and climatic variation. This interpretation supports previous conclusions that individual ecosystems may exist in equilibrial and non-equilibrial states at various temporal and spatial scales.},

@article{ogada_impacts_2008,
	Abstract = {Large native mammals are declining dramatically in abundance across Africa, with strong impacts on both plant and animal community dynamics. However, the net effects of this large-scale loss in megafauna are poorly understood because responses by several ecologically important groups have not been assessed. We used a large-scale, replicated exclusion experiment in Kenya to investigate the impacts of different guilds of native and domestic large herbivores on the diversity and abundance of birds over a 2-year period. The exclusion of large herbivorous native mammals, including zebras (Equus burchelli), giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis), elephants (Loxodonta africana), and buffalos ( Syncerus caffer), increased the diversity of birds by 30\%. Most of this effect was attributable to the absence of elephants and giraffes; these mega-herbivores reduced both the canopy area of subdominant woody vegetation and the biomass of ground-dwelling arthropods, and both of these factors were good predictors of the diversity of birds. The canopy area of subdominant trees was positively correlated with the diversity of granivorous birds. The biomass of ground-dwelling arthropods was positively correlated with the diversity of insectivorous birds. Our results suggest that most native large herbivores are compatible with an abundant and diverse bird fauna, as are cattle if they are at a relatively low stocking rate. Future research should focus on determining the spatial arrangements and densities of megaherbivores that will optimize both megaherbivore abundance and bird diversity.},

@article{morin_tree_2008,
	Abstract = {1. Climate change has already caused distribution shifts in many species, and climate predictions strongly suggest that these will accelerate in the future. Obtaining reliable predictions of species range shifts under climate change is thus currently one of the most crucial challenges for both ecologists and stakeholders. 2. Here we simulate the distributions of 16 North American tree species at a continental scale for the 21st century according to two IPCC storylines, using a process-based species distribution model that for the first time allows identification of the possible causes of distribution change. 3. Our projections show local extinctions in the south of species ranges (21\% of the present distribution, on average), and colonizations of new habitats in the north, though these are limited by dispersal ability for most species. Areas undergoing local extinctions are slightly larger under climate scenario A2 (+3.2 degrees C, +22\% on average) than B2 (+1.0 degrees C, +19\% on average). This small difference is caused by nonlinear responses of processes (leaves and flowers phenological processes in particular) to temperature. We also show that local extinction may proceed at a slower rate than forecasted so far. 4. Although predicted distribution shifts are very species-specific, we show that the loss of habitats southward will be mostly due to increased drought mortality and decreased reproductive success, while northward colonizations will be primarily promoted by increased probability of fruit ripening and flower frost survival. 5. Synthesis. Our results show that different species will not face the same risks due to climate change, because their responses to climate differ as well as their dispersal rate. Focusing on processes, our study therefore tempers the alarming conclusions of widely used niche-based models about biodiversity loss, mainly because our predictions take into account the local adaptation and trait plasticity to climate of the species.},

@article{almeras_biomechanical_2009,
	Abstract = {Studies on tree biomechanical design usually focus on stem stiffness, resistance to breakage or uprooting, and elastic stability. Here we consider another biomechanical constraint related to the interaction between growth and gravity. Because stems are slender structures and are never perfectly symmetric, the increase in tree mass always causes bending movements. Given the current mechanical design of trees, integration of these movements over time would ultimately lead to a weeping habit unless some gravitropic correction occurs. This correction is achieved by asymmetric internal forces induced during the maturation of new wood. The long-term stability of a growing stem therefore depends on how the gravitropic correction that is generated by diameter growth balances the disturbance due to increasing self weight. General mechanical formulations based on beam theory are proposed to model these phenomena. The rates of disturbance and correction associated with a growth increment are deduced and expressed as a function of elementary traits of stem morphology, cross-section anatomy and wood properties. Evaluation of these traits using previously published data shows that the balance between the correction and the disturbance strongly depends on the efficiency of the gravitropic correction, which depends on the asymmetry of wood maturation strain, eccentric growth, and gradients in wood stiffness. By combining disturbance and correction rates, the gravitropic performance indicates the dynamics of stem bending during growth. It depends on stem biomechanical traits and dimensions. By analyzing dimensional effects, we show that the necessity for gravitropic correction might constrain stem allometric growth in the long-term. This constraint is compared to the requirement for elastic stability, showing that gravitropic performance limits the increase in height of tilted stem and branches. The performance of this function may thus limit the slenderness and lean of stems, and therefore the ability of the tree to capture light in a heterogeneous environment. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) is a critical measure of the health and sustainability of natural ecosystems. Understanding the magnitude, spatial patterns and processes of GPP will underpin predictions of the impact of climate change on the carbon cycle. In Australia, savannas account for one third of the terrestrial carbon stores and therefore, estimating the magnitude of savanna GPP and studying the spatial relationship between GPP and environmental determinants at the regional scale is essential in understanding ecosystem responses to increasing atmospheric CO(2) concentrations and climate change. In this study we employed an integrated approach combining in situ measurements, eddy covariance based flux tower data and remote sensing techniques to examine the role of environmental drivers in controlling the spatial variation in GPP of savannas in the Northern Territory (NT), Australia. We used field based light use efficiency (LUE), regional specific meteorology and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) based fraction of absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fPAR) data to estimate GPP. The estimated GPP agreed quite well (only a 6\% error) with GPP estimated from flux tower at the Howard Springs site. The spatial pattern of GPP along the Northern Australian Tropical Transect (NATT) was calculated and showed a strong gradient in GPP from the coast (12.50 degrees S where rainfall was 1622 mm year(-1)) to inland (17.73 degrees S where mean rainfall was 643 mm year(-1)) with a decrease of 77\%. A decreasing trend in GPP with rainfall is noticed especially at the dry end of the transect studied. However, in the wet end and middle part of the transect (e.g. dominated by different Eucalyptus species), the response of GPP to changes in rainfall is reduced. This finding suggests that the influence of rainfall on various Eucalyptus species may be dampened by biotic factors. Our results suggest that future changes in precipitation driven by climate change may affect the future distribution and dynamics of GPP in northern Australia. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

@article{rastetter_responses_1997,
	Abstract = {Ecosystem responses to increased CO, are often constrained by nutrient limitation. We present a model of multiple-element limitation (MEL) and use it to analyze constraints imposed by N on the responses to an instantaneous doubling of CO2 concentration in a 350-yr-old eastern deciduous forest. We examine the effects of different exchange rates of inorganic N with sources and sinks external to the ecosystem (e,g., through deposition and leaching) and different initial ratios of net:gross N mineralization. Both of these factors influence the availability of N to vegetation and, therefore, have important effects on ecosystem responses to increased CO2. We conclude that reliable assessments of ecosystem responses to CO2 will require a better understanding of both these factors. The responses to increased CO2 appear on at least four characteristic time scares. (1) There is an instantaneous increase in net primary production, which results in an increase in the vegetation C:N ratio. (2) On a time scale of a few years, the vegetation responds by increasing uptake effort for available N (e.g., through increased allocation of biomass, energy, and enzymes to fine roots). (3) On a time scare of decades, there is a net movement of N from soil organic matter to vegetation, which enables vegetation biomass to accumulate. (4) On the time scale of centuries, ecosystem responses are dominated by increases in total ecosystem N, which enable organic matter to accumulate in both vegetation and soils. In general, short-term responses are markedly different from long-term responses.},

Prediction of net photosynthesis by the coupled model agreed well with the validation data, but the model tended to underestimate rates of stomatal conductance and transpiration.

	Abstract = {Range shifts due to climate change may cause species to move out of protected areas. Climate change could therefore result in species range dynamics that reduce the relevance of current fixed protected areas in future conservation strategies. Here, we apply species distribution modeling and conservation planning tools in three regions (Mexico, the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, and Western Europe) to examine the need for additional protected areas in light of anticipated species range shifts caused by climate change. We set species representation targets and assessed the area required to meet those targets in the present and in the future, under a moderate climate change scenario. Our findings indicate that protected areas can be an important conservation strategy in such a scenario, and that early action may be both more effective and less costly than inaction or delayed action. According to our projections, costs may vary among regions and none of the three areas studied will fully meet all conservation targets, even under a moderate climate change scenario. This suggests that limiting climate change is an essential complement to adding protected areas for conservation of biodiversity.},

	Abstract = {Invasive species cost the global economy billions of dollars each year, but ecologists have struggled to predict the risk of an introduced species naturalizing and invading. Although carefully designed experiments are needed to fully elucidate what makes some species invasive, much can be learned from unintentional experiments involving the introduction of species beyond their native ranges. Here, we assess invasion risk by linking a physiologically based species distribution model with data on the invasive success of 749 Australian acacia and eucalypt tree species that have, over more than a century, been introduced around the world. The model correctly predicts 92\% of occurrences observed outside of Australia from an independent dataset. We found that invasiveness is positively associated with the projection of physiological niche volume in geographic space, thereby illustrating that species tolerant of a broader range of environmental conditions are more likely to be invasive. Species achieve this broader tolerance in different ways, meaning that the traits that define invasive success are context-specific. Hence, our study reconciles studies that have failed to identify the traits that define invasive success with the urgent and pragmatic need to predict invasive success.},

	Abstract = {We model the dynamics of grass plant growth as a collection of the individual dynamic behavior of shoots and leaves. The model is inspired in data for plants of three species (Elyonurus adustus, Leptocoryphium lanatum and Andropogon semiberbis) of common grasses in the Venezuelan savannas that were sampled monthly for 1 year. These species represent different architecture and regeneration response to fire. Modules (shoots and leaves) were counted in each cell of a square grid in each one of several vertical levels. Module density per cell provides the horizontal distribution within a level and is aggregated by level to obtain vertical distribution. Both distributions are simulated by a dynamical model based on shoot emergence and mortality, elongation of shoots and leaves given by Richards' equation, plus a few simple geometric considerations. For quantitative comparisons of model results to data, the transient and final values for vertical distribution plus two metrics of horizontal distribution at each level, were calculated for the simulation results and the field data. Proportion of occupied cells and maximum distance to the center of growth were the two metrics selected to capture the dispersion and range of the horizontal distribution. The model results indicate predictable final vertical profiles (of proportional density plus the two metrics) similar to the profiles of measured distributions for each species. A reasonable prediction of the transient behavior was also obtained but with larger deviations as evaluated by the root mean square error between model and data. Differences in vertical and horizontal patterns of module density among species are explained by changing a set of parameter values related to growth form and phenology. Thus, the model could be applied to generate plant functional types for analysis of savanna dynamics subject to fire. With modifications, the model is potentially applicable to other grass plants and other grassland ecosystems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{ter_steege_hyperdominance_2013,
	Abstract = {The vast extent of the Amazon Basin has historically restricted the study of its tree communities to the local and regional scales. Here, we provide empirical data on the commonness, rarity, and richness of lowland tree species across the entire Amazon Basin and Guiana Shield (Amazonia), collected in 1170 tree plots in all major forest types. Extrapolations suggest that Amazonia harbors roughly 16,000 tree species, of which just 227 (1.4\%) account for half of all trees. Most of these are habitat specialists and only dominant in one or two regions of the basin. We discuss some implications of the finding that a small group of species---less diverse than the North American tree flora---accounts for half of the world's most diverse tree community.
Introduction Recent decades have seen a major international effort to inventory tree communities in the Amazon Basin and Guiana Shield (Amazonia), but the vast extent and record diversity of these forests have hampered an understanding of basinwide patterns. To overcome this obstacle, we compiled and standardized species-level data on more than half a million trees in 1170 plots sampling all major lowland forest types to explore patterns of commonness, rarity, and richness.
A map of Amazonia showing the location of the 1430 Amazon Tree Diversity Network (ATDN) plots that contributed data to this paper. The white polygon marks our delimitation of the study area and consists of 567 1$\,^{\circ}$ grid cells (area = 6.29 million km2). Orange circles indicate plots on terra firme; blue squares, plots on seasonally or permanently flooded terrain (v{\'a}rzea, igap{\'o}, swamps); yellow triangles, plots on white-sand podzols; gray circles, plots only used for tree density calculations. Background is from Visible Earth. CA, central Amazonia; EA, eastern Amazonia; GS, Guyana Shield; SA, southern Amazonia; WAN, northern part of western Amazonia; WAS, southern part of western Amazonia. More details are shown in figs. S1 to S3.
Methods The {\textasciitilde}6-million-km2 Amazonian lowlands were divided into 1$\,^{\circ}$ cells, and mean tree density was estimated for each cell by using a loess regression model that included no environmental data but had its basis exclusively in the geographic location of tree plots. A similar model, allied with a bootstrapping exercise to quantify sampling error, was used to generate estimated Amazon-wide abundances of the 4962 valid species in the data set. We estimated the total number of tree species in the Amazon by fitting the mean rank-abundance data to Fisher's log-series distribution.
Results Our analyses suggest that lowland Amazonia harbors 3.9 × 1011 trees and {\textasciitilde}16,000 tree species. We found 227 ``hyperdominant'' species (1.4\% of the total) to be so common that together they account for half of all trees in Amazonia, whereas the rarest 11,000 species account for just 0.12\% of trees. Most hyperdominants are habitat specialists that have large geographic ranges but are only dominant in one or two regions of the basin, and a median of 41\% of trees in individual plots belong to hyperdominants. A disproportionate number of hyperdominants are palms, Myristicaceae, and Lecythidaceae.
Discussion The finding that Amazonia is dominated by just 227 tree species implies that most biogeochemical cycling in the world's largest tropical forest is performed by a tiny sliver of its diversity. The causes underlying hyperdominance in these species remain unknown. Both competitive superiority and widespread pre-1492 cultivation by humans are compelling hypotheses that deserve testing. Although the data suggest that spatial models can effectively forecast tree community composition and structure of unstudied sites in Amazonia, incorporating environmental data may yield substantial improvements. An appreciation of how thoroughly common species dominate the basin has the potential to simplify research in Amazonian biogeochemistry, ecology, and vegetation mapping. Such advances are urgently needed in light of the {\textgreater}10,000 rare, poorly known, and potentially threatened tree species in the Amazon.
Seeing the Trees in the Forest
Despite botanical exploration over two centuries, knowledge of the species composition and quantitative distribution of the trees of the Amazonian forest has remained decidedly patchy. Ter Steege et al. (1243092) report the results from a network of 1170 tree plots arrayed across the Amazon Basin and Guiana Shield, in which the species of all trees with stem diameter {\textgreater}10 centimeters were identified. The tree flora comprised a total of about 16,000 species. However, just 227 very common Amazonian species accounted for half of the trees in the Amazon---the world's most diverse forest.},

@article{werner_size-specific_2001,
	Abstract = {The biomass of component parts of individuals of three dominant canopy tree species in the northern savannas of Australia was determined from field populations in World Heritage Kakadu National Park. Forty individual trees of Eucalyptus tetrodonta F. Muell., E. miniata Cunn. ex Schauer and E. papuana F. Muell., representing a range in size from 4 to 50 cm diameter at breast height (DBH), were felled for dry biomass of leaves, branches, woody stems and bark. Forty-seven other trees of E. tetrodonta and E. miniata were excavated for belowground biomass, by using trenching methods. The average proportion of aboveground biomass in foliage was 3-5\%, to branches 20-32\%, and trunk wood 77-59\%, with little change over the size of a tree. Water content of foliage decreased with size of tree in all species, indicating an increasing xeromorphy as the trees age. Gross morphology of roots was bimorphic, with 70\% of biomass at {\textless}20-cm soil depth, and large roots running horizontally on top of the shallow (0.3-1.4 m) ferricrete layer. There was no evidence of roots having access to water below this layer. Patterns of heights, percentage biomass allocation, percentage water content, and bark thickness of the three species were consistent with the rank order of their distributions across a topographic gradient, reflecting relative capacities to withstand drought, belowground competition and fire. By using tree diameter as the independent variable (x in cm DBH), allometric relationships were calculated to provide a method for calculating growth and productivity by using non-destructive repeat measures of sizes of trees. The total aboveground biomass (y in kg) of individual trees is y = 0.2068x(2.3191) for E. tetrodonta, y = 0.1527x(2.390) for E. miniata and y = 0.0356x(2.8567) for E. papuana. Total belowground biomass per tree for E. tetrodonta is y = 31.150e(0.0601x) and for E. miniata, y = 28.753e(0.0644x). As a tree grows, the aboveground biomass increases as a power function and belowground biomass as an exponential function of DBH, producing a decreasing proportion of total biomass below ground, e.g. the root/shoot ratio of E. tetrodonta is 0.50 for trees {\textless}10 cm DBH, 0.40 for trees 20 cm DBH, and 0.25 for trees 40-55 cm DBH. The overall proportion of total biomass below ground in Kakadu is well below 50\%, contrary to the commonly accepted notion that the majority of biomass in savannas is below ground.},

	Abstract = {The Mt. Graham red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus grahamensis; MGRS) is among the most critically endangered mammals in the United States and is isolated on the periphery of the species' range, potentially increasing its conservation priority. To investigate potential threats to the population and provide a tool for land managers, we developed a spatially explicit population dynamics model. We tested model predictions using available range-wide data from the literature and field work specific to the MGRS. A general model input data set using mean life history values overpredicted MGRS abundance. However, we found significant correlation with known squirrel abundance using a general data set with curtailed fecundity and survival. A model with MGRS-specific data provided the best fit to observed population size. We investigated potential impacts of two major threats to the MGRS: competition from introduced Abert's squirrels (Sciurus aberti) and increased levels of predation. Predation and particularly competition could have significant effects on the future population of the MGRS. Careful attention must be used to model the viability of fringe populations as peripheral populations can have a different life history than populations found in the range core.},

A primary mechanism underlying the modeled positive feedback is the kinetic sensitivity of photosynthesis and respiration to temperature. Field experiments, however, suggest much richer mechanisms driving ecosystem responses to climate warming, including extended growing seasons, enhanced nutrient availability, shifted species composition, and altered ecosystem-water dynamics. The diverse mechanisms likely define more possibilities of carbon-climate feedbacks than projected by the kinetics-based models. Nonetheless, experimental results are so variable that we have not generated the necessary insights on ecosystem responses to effectively improve global models. To constrain model projections of carbon-climate feedbacks, we need more empirical data from whole-ecosystem warming experiments across a wide range of biomes, particularly in tropic regions, and closer interactions between models and experiments.},

@article{illius_relevance_1999,
	Abstract = {The dynamics of arid and semiarid grazing systems are prone to the effects of highly variable rainfall, with droughts causing frequent episodic mortality in herbivore populations. This has led to the suggestion that they are nonequilibrium systems, in which animal impacts on plants are strongly attenuated or absent. We examine the utility and appropriateness of nonequilibrium concepts for understanding ecosystem processes in African rangeland, attempt to distinguish disequilibrium from nonequilibrium, and argue that such concepts do not justify the view that herbivory has little impact in climatically variable systems. We present evidence for an alternative view of African rangeland function. We argue that, despite the apparent lack of equilibrium, animal numbers are regulated in a density-dependent manner by the limited forage available in key resource areas, which are utilized in the dry season. This model asserts that strong equilibrial fords exist over a limited part of the system, with the animal population being virtually uncoupled from resources elsewhere in the system. Spatially and temporally, the whole system is heterogeneous in the strength of the forces tending to equilibrium, these diminishing with distance from watering and key resource areas and during the wet season. We argue that wet-season range is more heavily utilized by animal populations sustained by key resource areas than would apply in the absence of key resources, and that uncoupling of the animal population from vegetation carries an increased risk of degradation. Droughts may impose intense and localized defoliation on vegetation, and this may result in altered species composition, reduced rain-use efficiency, soil erosion, and loss of productive potential. Rather than ignoring degradation, policy-makers and ecologists should seek to identify the characteristics of grazing systems that predispose some systems toward degradation, while others appear to be resistant. Development policies should focus on the spatial heterogeneity in susceptibility to grazing impacts and on preserving the productive capacity of key resource areas.},

@article{korner_re-assessment_1998,
	Abstract = {In this review I first compile data for the worldwide position of climate-driven alpine treelines. Causes for treeline formation are then discussed with a global perspective. Available evidence suggests a combination of a general thermal boundary for tree growth, with regionally variable "modulatory" forces, including the presence of certain taxa. Much of the explanatory evidence found in the literature relates to these modulatory aspects at regional scales, whereas no good explanations emerged for the more fundamental global pattern related to temperature per se, on which this review is focused. I hypothesize that the life form "tree" is limited at treeline altitudes by the potential investment, rather than production, of assimilates (growth as such, rather than photosynthesis or the carbon balance, being limited). In shoots coupled to a cold atmosphere, meristem activity is suggested to be limited for much of the time, especially at night. By reducing soil heat flux during the growing season the forest canopy negatively affects root zone temperature. The lower threshold temperature for tissue growth and development appears to be higher than 3 degrees C and lower than 10 degrees C, possibly in the 5.5-7.5 degrees C range, most commonly associated with seasonal means of air temperature at treeline positions. The physiological and developmental mechanisms responsible have yet to be analyzed. Root zone temperature, though largely unknown, is likely to be most critical.},

	Abstract = {First, we report the results of the longest-known field study (9 years) to examine the effects of elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) on leaf miner densities in a scrub-oak community at Kennedy Space Center, Florida. Here, the densities of all leaf miner species (6) on all host species (3) were lower in every year in elevated CO2 than they were in ambient CO2. Second, meta-analyses were used to review the effects of elevated CO2 on both plants (n=59 studies) and herbivores (n=75 studies). The log of the response ratio was chosen as the metric to calculate effect sizes. Results showed that elevated CO2 significantly decreased herbivore abundance (-21.6\%), increased relative consumption rates (+16.5\%), development time (+3.87\%) and total consumption (+9.2\%), and significantly decreased relative growth rate (-8.3\%), conversion efficiency (-19.9\%) and pupal weight (-5.03\%). No significant differences were observed among herbivore guilds. Host plants growing under enriched CO2 environments exhibited significantly larger biomass (+38.4\%), increased C/N ratio (+26.57\%), and decreased nitrogen concentration (-16.4\%), as well as increased concentrations of tannins (+29.9\%) and other phenolics. Effects of changes on plant primary and secondary chemistry due to elevated CO2 and consequences for herbivore growth and development are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Global controls on month-by-month fractional burnt area (2000--2005) were investigated by fitting a generalised linear model (GLM) to Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) data, with 11 predictor variables representing vegetation, climate, land use and potential ignition sources. Burnt area is shown to increase with annual net primary production (NPP), number of dry days, maximum temperature, grazing-land area, grass/shrub cover and diurnal temperature range, and to decrease with soil moisture, cropland area and population density. Lightning showed an apparent (weak) negative influence, but this disappeared when pure seasonal-cycle effects were taken into account. The model predicts observed geographic and seasonal patterns, as well as the emergent relationships seen when burnt area is plotted against each variable separately. Unimodal relationships with mean annual temperature and precipitation, population density and gross domestic product (GDP) are reproduced too, and are thus shown to be secondary consequences of correlations between different controls (e.g. high NPP with high precipitation; low NPP with low population density and GDP). These findings have major implications for the design of global fire models, as several assumptions in current models -- most notably, the widely assumed dependence of fire frequency on ignition rates -- are evidently incorrect.},

@article{westoby_plant_2002,
	Abstract = {An important aim of plant ecology is to identify leading dimensions of ecological variation among species and to understand the basis for them. Dimensions that can readily be measured would be especially useful, because they might offer a path towards improved worldwide synthesis across the thousands of field experiments and ecophysiological studies that use just a few species each. Four dimensions are reviewed here. The leaf mass per area-leaf lifespan (LMA-LL) dimension expresses slow turnover of plant parts (at high LMA and long LL), long nutrient residence times, and slow response to favorable growth conditions. The seed mass-seed output (SM-SO) dimension is an important predictor of dispersal to establishment opportunities (seed output) and of establishment success in the face of hazards (seed mass). The LMA-LL and SM-SO dimensions are each underpinned by a single, comprehensible tradeoff, and their consequences are fairly well understood. The leaf size-twig size (LS-TS) spectrum has obvious consequences for the texture of canopies, but the costs and benefits of large versus small leaf and twig size are poorly understood. The height dimension has universally been seen as ecologically important and included in ecological strategy schemes. Nevertheless, height includes several tradeoffs and adaptive elements, which ideally should be treated separately. Each of these four dimensions varies at the scales of climate zones and of site types within landscapes. This variation can be interpreted as adaptation to the physical environment. Each dimension also varies widely among coexisting species. Most likely this within-site variation arises because the ecological opportunities for each species depend strongly on which other species are present, in other words, because the set of species at a site is a stable mixture of strategies.},

However, the importance of 'persistence' in plant demography has been neglected in favour of 'recruitment' Thus much research on plant regeneration, conservation and evolution has focused on the importance of safe sites, seed and seedling banks, dispersal and germination with the implied importance of de novo replacement rather than persistence. Recent research shows a growing appreciation for the role of sprouting as a form of persistence in a diversity of ecosystems and tradeoffs between the two regeneration modes.},

In this study, we show that the LPJ-GUESS dynamic vegetation model reproduces the magnitude of the NPP enhancement at temperate forest FACE experiments. A global application of the model suggests that the response found in the experiments might also be representative of the average response of forests globally. However, the predicted NPP enhancement in tropical forests is more than twice as high as in boreal forests, suggesting that currently available FACE results are not applicable to these ecosystems. The modeled geographic pattern is to a large extent driven by the temperature dependence of the relative affinities of the primary assimilation enzyme (Rubisco) for CO2 and O-2.},

@article{alcock_positive_2003,
	Abstract = {Positive feedback has the potential to create multiple steady states that divide system space into regions of distinct behavioral modes. Graphical analysis can be used to recognize systems likely to behave in this way. For example, positive feedback created by interactions among tropical forest, regional hydrology, and climate in the Amazon basin may produce multiple steady states. As deforestation progresses, one state-the normal forest with a high leaf area index-is stable and promotes system resilience. However, deforestation can cause the system to shift toward and past a second, unstable state at moderate levels of forest cover. The latter separates forest stability in the face of stress from runaway behavior and system collapse into an alternative grassland ecology. To test this inference, a two-dimensional finite-difference model has been constructed that includes parameterizations of the functions controlling feedback. Results of the experiment indicate that human-driven deforestation may shift regions of the Amazonian ecosystem to instability after 25\%-30\% of the forest has been permanently cleared, within two to four decades if the current practice is maintained. Even a temporary loss of the Amazon forest or significant portions of it would negatively impact terrestrial biodiversity.},

@article{morales_rainfall-controlled_2004,
	Abstract = {It is generally assumed that tree growth in the upper limit of a forest is mainly controlled by summer temperature. This general statement is mostly based on studies from extra-tropical mountains and has been rarely evaluated in subtropical latitudes frequently characterized by drier climates. In the subtropical mountains from Northwestern Argentina (similar to23degrees S), annual precipitation decreases with elevation from {\textgreater} 1500 mm at 12001500 m. to {\textless}200 mm above 4000 m. In consequence, tree growth at high elevations in the region may be seriously limited by water supply. In order to assess the influence of precipitation on tree growth, we evaluated the relationships between climatic variations and radial growth in four species growing at different altitudinal zones: Juglans australis from the montane cloud forest at 1800 m; Alnus acuminata from the montane savanna-like woodland at 2700 m; Prosopis ferox from the subalpine dryland at 3500 m; and Polylepis tarapacana from the high-elevation alpine dryland at 4750 m. Dendrochronological techniques were used to relate variations in annual ring width with instrumental climatic records. Growth rings were correctly dated to the year of formation, and the cross-dated series standardized using autoregressive models to reduce non-climatic signals present in the records. Tree-ring chronologies, ranging from 117 to 341 years, were compared, during the common period, with instrumental climatic records using correlation-function analysis. In spite of the remarkable differences in elevation and environmental conditions among the sampling sites, correlation functions with climate indicated that the radial growth of the four species is largely controlled by precipitation. In most cases, increased precipitation during the previous and current growing seasons favors tree growth, while temperatures are negatively correlated with radial growth, likely due to the negative effect on water availability. These results indicate that the generalized idea of upper-treeline growth limited by summer temperatures should be carefully evaluated in low-latitude environments and does not apply to subtropical areas with severe water deficits or strong moisture seasonalities.},

@article{russell-smith_bushfires_2007,
	Abstract = {Australia is among the most fire-prone of continents. While national fire management policy is focused on irregular and comparatively smaller fires in densely settled southern Australia, this comprehensive assessment of continental-scale fire patterning ( 1997-2005) derived from similar to 1 km(2) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery shows that fire activity occurs predominantly in the savanna landscapes of monsoonal northern Australia. Statistical models that relate the distribution of large fires to a variety of biophysical variables show that, at the continental scale, rainfall seasonality substantially explains fire patterning. Modelling results, together with data concerning seasonal lightning incidence, implicate the importance of anthropogenic ignition sources, especially in the northern wet-dry tropics and arid Australia, for a substantial component of recurrent fire extent. Contemporary patterns differ markedly from those under Aboriginal occupancy, are causing significant impacts on biodiversity, and, under current patterns of human population distribution, land use, national policy and climate change scenarios, are likely to prevail, if not intensify, for decades to come. Implications of greenhouse gas emissions from savanna burning, especially seasonal emissions of CO(2), are poorly understood and contribute to important underestimation of the significance of savanna emissions both in Australian and probably in international greenhouse gas inventories. A significant challenge for Australia is to address annual fire extent in fire-prone Australian savannas.},

@article{white_impact_1999,
	Abstract = {Recent research suggests that increases in growing-season length (GSL) in mid-northern latitudes may be partially responsible for increased forest growth and carbon sequestration. We used the BIOME-BGC ecosystem model to investigate the impacts of including a dynamically regulated GSL on simulated carbon and water balance over a historical 88-year record (1900-1987) for 12 sites in the eastern USA deciduous broadleaf forest. For individual sites, the predicted GSL regularly varied by more than 15 days. When grouped into three climatic zones, GSL variability was still large and rapid. There is a recent trend in colder, northern sites toward a longer GSL, but not in moderate and warm climates. The results show that, for all sites, prediction of a long GSL versus using the mean GSL increased net ecosystem production (NEP), gross primary production (GPP), and evapotranspiration (ET); conversely a short GSL is predicted to decrease these parameters. On an absolute basis, differences in GPP between the dynamic and mean GSL simulations were larger than the differences in NEP. As a percentage difference, though, NEP was much more sensitive to changes in GSL than were either GPP or ET. On average, a 1-day change in GSL changed NEP by 1.6\%, GPP by 0.5\%, and ET by 0.2\%. Predictions of NEP and GPP in cold climates were more sensitive to changes in GSL than were predictions in warm climates. ET was not similarly sensitive. First, our results strongly agree with field measurements showing a high correlation between NEP and dates of spring growth, and second they suggest that persistent increases in GSL may lead to longterm increases in carbon storage.},

	Abstract = {Changes in vegetation structure and biogeography due to climate change feedback to alter climate by changing fluxes of energy, moisture, and momentum between land and atmosphere. While the current class of land process models used with climate models parameterizes these fluxes in detail, these models prescribe surface vegetation and leaf area from data sets. In this paper, we describe an approach in which ecological concepts from a global vegetation dynamics model are added to the land component of a climate model to grow plants interactively. The vegetation dynamics model is the Lund-Potsdam-Jena (LPJ) dynamic global vegetation model. The land model is the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Land Surface Model (LSM). Vegetation is defined in terms of plant functional types. Each plant functional type is represented by an individual plant with the average biomass, crown area, height, and stem diameter (trees only) of its population, by the number of individuals in the population, and by the fractional cover in the grid cell. Three time-scales (minutes, days, and years) govern the processes. Energy fluxes, the hydrologic cycle, and carbon assimilation, core processes in LSM, occur at a 20 min time step. Instantaneous net assimilated carbon is accumulated annually to update vegetation once a year. This is carried out with the addition of establishment, resource competition, growth, mortality, and fire parameterizations from LPJ. The leaf area index is updated daily based on prevailing environmental conditions, but the maximum value depends on the annual vegetation dynamics. The coupling approach is successful. The model simulates global biogeography, net primary production, and dynamics of tundra, boreal forest, northern hardwood forest, tropical rainforest, and savanna ecosystems, which are consistent with observations. This suggests that the model can be used with a climate model to study biogeophysical feedbacks in the climate system related to vegetation dynamics.},

	Abstract = {The savannas (cerrado) of south-central Brazil are currently,subjected to frequent anthropogenic burning, causing widespread reduction in tree density. Increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2 could reduce the impact of such frequent burning by increasing the availability of nonstructural carbohydrate, which is necessary for resprouting. We tested the hypotheses that elevated CO2 stimulates resprouting and accelerates replenishment of carbohydrate reserves. Using a factorial experiment, seedlings of a common Brazilian savanna tree, Keilmeyera,ern coriacea, were grown at 350 ppm and 700 ppm CO2 and at two nutrient levels. To simulate burning, the plants were either clipped at 15 weeks or were left unclipped. Among unclipped plants, CO2 and nutrients both stimulated growth, with no significant interaction between nutrient and CO2 effects. Among clipped plants, both CO2 and nutrients stimulated resprouting. However, there was a strong interaction between CO2 and nutrient effects, with CO2 having a significant effect only in the presence of high nutrient availability. Under elevated CO2, carbohydrate reserves remained at higher levels following clipping. Root total nonstructural carbohydrate remained above 36\% in all treatments, so carbohydrate reserves did not limit regrowth. These results indicate that under elevated CO2 this species may be better able to endure the high frequency of anthropogenic burning in the Brazilian savannas.},

	Abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity is considered the major means by which plants cope with environmental heterogeneity. Although ubiquitous in nature, actual phenotypic plasticity is far from being maximal. This has been explained by the existence of internal limits to its expression. However, phenotypic plasticity takes place within an ecological context and plants are generally exposed to multifactor environments and to simultaneous interactions with many species. These external, ecological factors may limit phenotypic plasticity or curtail its adaptive value, but seldom have they been considered because limits to plasticity have typically addressed factors internal to the plant. We show that plastic responses to abiotic factors are reduced under situations of conservative resource use in stressful and unpredictable habitats, and that extreme levels in a given abiotic factor can negatively influence plastic responses to another factor. We illustrate how herbivory may limit plant phenotypic plasticity because damaged plants can only rarely attain the optimal phenotype in the challenging environment. Finally, it is examined how phenotypic changes involved in trait- mediated interactions can entail costs for the plant in further interactions with other species in the community. Ecological limits to plasticity must be included in any realistic approach to understand the evolution of plasticity in complex environments and to predict plant responses to global change.},

@article{buitenwerf_increased_nodate,
	Abstract = {For the past century, woody plants have increased in grasslands and savannas worldwide. Woody encroachment may significantly alter ecosystem functioning including fire regimes, herbivore carrying capacity, biodiversity and carbon storage capacity. Traditionally, increases in woody cover and density have been ascribed to changes in the disturbance regime (fire and herbivores) or rainfall. Increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations may also contribute, by increasing growth rates of trees relative to grasses. This hypothesis is still heavily debated because usually potential CO2 effects are confounded by changes in land use (disturbance regime). Here we analyse changes in woody density in fire experiments at three sites in South African savannas where the disturbance regime (fire and herbivores) was kept constant for 30 and 50 years. If global drivers had significant effects on woody plants, we would expect significant increases in tree densities and biomass over time under the constant disturbance regime. Woody density remained constant in a semiarid savanna but tripled in a mesic savanna between the 1970s and 1990s. At the third site, a semiarid savanna near the southern limits of the biome, tree density doubled from the mid 1990s to 2010. Interpretation of the causes is confounded by population recovery after clearing, but aerial photograph analysis on adjacent non-cleared areas showed an accompanying 48\% increase in woody cover. Increased CO2 concentrations are consistent with increased woody density while other global drivers (rainfall) remained constant over the duration of the experiments. The absence of a response in one semiarid savanna could be explained by a smaller carbon sink capacity of the dominant species, which would therefore benefit less from increased CO2. Understanding how savannas and grasslands respond to increased CO2 and identifying the causes of woody encroachment are essential for the successful management of these systems.},

@article{van_der_hammen_neogene_2000,
	Abstract = {The neotropical Amazonian and Andean plant diversity developed mainly during the Tertiary. In Amazonia, Miocene floral diversity seems considerably higher than today. During the Neogene, tropical taxa entered newly created montane area, and montane taxa entered the tropical lowlands. The general decrease of temperature during the upper Neogene and especially during the Quaternary glacial periods may have caused considerable extinctions in the lowlands. Representation of pollen of apparently principally montane taxa (Podocarpus, Hedyosmum) in Miocene, Pliocene, and Quaternary sediments of Amazonia and surroundings, is still difficult to interpret in terms of temperature decrease at low elevation. Changes in precipitation may have profound impact on the composition of vegetation communities; Ilex and Melastomataceae increase significantly in many glacial pollen records. Increase of Weinmannia in Amazonian pollen records seems the best indicator of downward migration of montane vegetation belts. A temperature lowering at sea-level of 4.5 $\pm$1$\,^{\circ}$C during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) seems reasonable; it may have caused a downslope migration of some 700 m of the lower montane vegetation belt; lower montane arboreal species may have been able to grow in higher elevation areas (\&gt;500 m) of Amazonia, increasing background pollen values of montane taxa in the area.

Difference between a cool and wet Middle Pleniglacial (60--28 ka BP), and a cold and dry Upper Pleniglacial (28--14 ka BP; thus including the LGM) is evident in Andean and Amazonian records; statements about environmental conditions of the ice-age Amazon should be specified chronologically. The Middle Pleniglacial is a time of accumulation of fluvial sediments. The Upper Pleniglacial is a time of incision of the rivers in their sediments; sedimentation started again in the Lateglacial (since ca. 13 ka BP) and the Holocene, when lake levels rose again. Based on simplified considerations of precipitation changes and evaporation we estimate that LGM rainfall may have been reduced by values of ca. 45($\pm$10\%); Amazonian and Cordilleran lakes dried up; dry rain forest was locally replaced by savanna, savanna forest, or cerrado-type vegetation; dry rain forest, savanna forest, and pure savanna was locally replaced by extensive semi-desert dune formations (lower Rio Branco area in present-day central Amazonia). The present-day centers of higher rainfall (\&gt;2500 mm) surrounded by areas of lower rainfall, are refuge areas of the very wet rain forest and of the very high plant diversity (300 plant species per 0.1 ha), and they should have been that equally, or more, during the dry climate intervals (plant diversity of drier forests is in the order of 100--150 species per 0.1 ha). Both extinction and speciation in isolation under precipitation and temperature stress may have taken place in these refugia.},

@article{zavala_mechanistic_2005,
	Abstract = {Mechanistic theories of plant competition developed to explain changes in community structure and dynamics along resource availability gradients have been mostly applied to temperate forests and grasslands where light and nutrients are the two main limiting resources. In contrast, the mechanisms underlying the structure and dynamics of water-limited plant communities have been little explored. Also previous mechanistic models rely either on complex simulators, which are difficult to interpret or on simple conceptual models, which ignore too many critical details. In this study, we develop a model of stand dynamics for light and water-limited forests of intermediate complexity and we provide an analytical framework for its analyses. The model is an individual-based simulator that describes the feedback between transpiration, stomatal function and soil water dynamics with asymmetrical competition for light and water. Trees allocate carbon to three main compartments: shoot, stem and roots. We use the model to explore general patterns that may emerge across levels of biological organization from the leaf to the stand. Model predictions are consistent with a number of features of Mediterranean forests structure and dynamics. At the plant-level the leaf-based tradeoff between carbon gain and water loss expresses as a tradeoff between mortality and growth. This tradeoff explains plant morphological changes in above-ground biomass and root to shoot allocation along a water availability gradient. At the community-level, tradeoffs among carbon acquisition and water loss govern the sign of plant interactions along the gradient. Coexistence among morphological types was not observed for the range of parameters and environmental conditions explored. Overall the model provides an unifying explanation for the observed changes in the sign of plant to plant interactions along environmental gradients as well as a process-based formulation that can be linked to empirical studies.

@article{voinov_modular_2004,
	Abstract = {The Library of Hydro-Ecological Modules (LHEM, http://giee.uvm.edu/LHEM) was designed to create flexible landscape model structures that can be easily modified and extended to suit the requirements of a variety of goals and case studies. The LHEM includes modules that simulate hydrologic processes, nutrient cycling, vegetation growth, decomposition, and other processes, both locally and spatially. Where possible the modules are formulated as S℡LA(R) models, which adds to transparency and helps reuse. Spatial transport processes are presented as C++ code. The modular approach takes advantage of the spatial modeling environment (http://giee.uvm.edu/SME3) that allows integration of various S℡LA models and C++ user code, and embeds local simulation models into a spatial context. Using the LHEM/SME the Patuxent landscape model (PLM) was built to simulate fundamental ecological processes in the watershed scale driven by temporal (nutrient loadings, climatic conditions) and spatial (land use patterns) forcings. Local ecosystem dynamics were replicated across a grid of cells that compose the rasterized landscape. Different habitats and land use types translate into different modules and parameter sets. Spatial hydrologic modules link the cells together. These are also part of the LHEM and define horizontal fluxes of material and information. This approach provides additional flexibility in scaling up and down over a range of spatial resolutions. Model results show good agreement with data for several components of the model at several scales. Other applications include several subwatersheds of the Patuxent, the Gwynns Falls watershed in Baltimore, and others. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Within the past decade, several global land cover data sets derived from satellite observations have become available to the scientific community. They offer valuable information on the current state of the Earth's land surface. However, considerable disagreements among them and classification legends not primarily suited for specific applications such as carbon cycle model parameterizations pose significant challenges and uncertainties in the use of such data sets. This paper addresses the user community of global land cover products. We first review and compare several global land cover products, i.e. the Global Land Cover Characterization Database (GLCC), Global Land Cover 2000 (GLC2000), and the MODIS land cover product, and highlight individual strengths and weaknesses of mapping approaches. Our overall objective is to present a straightforward method that merges existing products into a desired classification legend. This process follows the idea of convergence of evidence and generates a 'best-estimate' data set using fuzzy agreement. We apply our method to develop a new joint I-km global land cover product (SYNMAP) with improved characteristics for land cover parameterization of the carbon cycle models that reduces land cover uncertainties in carbon budget calculations. The overall advantage of the SYNMAP legend is that all classes are properly defined in terms of plant functional type mixtures, which can be remotely sensed and include the definitions of leaf type and longevity for each class with a tree component. SYNMAP is currently used for parameterization in a European model intercomparison initiative of three global vegetation models: BIOME-BGC, LPJ, and ORCHIDEE. Corroboration of SYNMAP against GLCC, GLC2000 and MODIS land cover products reveals improved agreement of SYNMAP with all other land cover products and therefore indicates the successful exploration of synergies between the different products. However, given that we cannot provide extensive validation using reference data we are unable to prove that SYNMAP is actually more accurate. SYNMAP is available on request from Martin Jung.

From a global climatic perspective the dominance of evergreen rather than deciduous trees in the Australian savannas is apparently anomalous when compared with other savannas of the world. However, this pattern is not unexpected in light of existing theory that emphasises photosynthetic return relative to cost of investment between deciduous and evergreen species. (a) Climatically, monsoonal Australia is more extreme in terms of rainfall seasonality and variability and high air temperatures than most other parts of the seasonally dry tropics. Existing theory predicts that extreme variability and high temperatures favour evergreen trees that can maximise the period during which leaves assimilate CO2. (b) Soil infertility is known to favour evergreens, given the physiological cost of leaf construction, and the northern Australian vegetation grows mainly on deeply weathered and infertile Tertiary regoliths. (c) These regoliths also provide stores of ground water that evergreens are able to exploit during seasonal drought, thereby maintaining near constant transpiration throughout the year. (d) Fire disturbance appears to be an important secondary factor in explaining the dominance of evergreens in the monsoon tropics, based on the fact that most deciduous tree species of the region are restricted to small fire-protected sites. (e) Evolutionary history cannot explain the predominance of evergreens, given the existence of a wide range of deciduous species, including deciduous eucalypts, in the regional tree flora.},

For all such systems, linear programming shows in general that the optimal strategy in any time step is to prioritize removal of a single age or stage class.

Acclimation of photosynthesis during long-term exposure to elevated C-a reduces key enzymes of the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle, and this increases nutrient use efficiency. Improved soil-water balance, increased carbon uptake in the shade, greater carbon to nitrogen ratio, and reduced nutrient quality for insect and animal grazers are all possibilities that have been observed in field studies of the effects of elevated C-a.

	Abstract = {One of the pressing problems for applied ecologists is the efficient restoration of structure and function to degraded ecosystems. Where some other conservation activities, such as protection of existing wilderness, continue to require making the best of increasingly bad situations, the goal of restoration raises the pleasing prospect of measurable improvement in landscapes. Restoration simultaneously provides the ultimate test for the discipline of community ecology: ecologists should be able to build an ecosystem in the same way an engineer builds a bridge, with a list of parts connected in specified ways leading to certain reliable outcomes. Failures would reveal that scientists do not adequately understand the system. Practical considerations suggest the application of tools that already exist rather than the invention of new ones. The objective of this paper is to suggest that two valuable tools may already exist, tools that provide an intellectual foundation for restoration ecology. Such a foundation is necessary because there has been a tendency for restoration ecology to represent a haphazard collection of individual cases rather than a well-defined discipline with repeatable methods. One possible scheme for unifying studies of restoration is that provided by assembly rules, where predictions are based upon key environmental factors and the responses of species to those factors. The potential of such assembly rules is introduced using three examples: fish in wetlands, plants in salt marshes, and plants in prairie potholes. I then describe an experiment where a standard species pool of wetland plants was sown into twenty-four different sets of environmental conditions, illustrating how landscapes can select communities out of larger pools. A second possible tool is indicators of ecosystem integrity. These can measure whether a project actually works. Clear discrimination between success and failure can improve restoration procedures by accelerating the evolution of management principles and techniques; Holling has called this process 'adaptive environmental assessment.' I conclude with the optimistic view that restoration already has the tools for continued progress; what is needed is primarily their intelligent application. That is, rather than ending with a typically academic plea for more research, I suggest (for a change) char what is needed is only the discriminating application of procedures and principles that already exist.},

Calculated leaf dispersion factors of both species were linearly correlated with downward cumulative LAI of the mixture and appeared to be the principal cause for variation in the extinction coefficient (k) with canopy height. This relationship was negative for clover and positive for grass, corresponding with a shift from regular leaf dispersion in the top layers to a clumped dispersion in the bottom layers for clover and the reverse pattern for grass. Measured light profiles could be exactly mimicked with a modified version of a general multi-layer light competition model by incorporating for both species leaf dispersion as a function of downward cumulative LAI in combination with fitted dispersion-free values of k which only reflect the leaf-angle distribution. Competitive success of clover over grass for light absorption in this study was, next to its greater contribution to total LAI and a more planofile leaf-angle distribution, related to its higher position in the mixture where maximum leaf area density occurred and regular leaf dispersion in the top layers of the canopy. These last two characteristics were especially manifest in the large-leaved clover. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Patterns of growth, activity and renewal of stems and branches are primary determinants of ecosystem function and strongly influence net primary productivity, water and energy balance. Here we compare patterns of leaf phenology, stem radial growth and branch growth of co-occurring savanna and forest trees in the Cerrado region of central Brazil to gain insight into the influence of these parameters in forest-savanna boundary dynamics. We hypothesized that forest species would have higher radial growth rates but later leaf flush than savanna species. We studied 12 congeneric species pairs, each containing one savanna species and one forest species. All individuals were growing in savanna conditions under full sun. We measured specific leaf area (SLA), light-saturated photosynthesis and monthly increments in stem circumference, branch length, leaf flush and leaf fall. Relative to savanna species, forest species had 68\% higher diameter growth rates, 38\% higher SLA, and displayed a greater crown area for a given basal area. Across species, radial growth was positively correlated with SLA (r(2) = 0 center dot 31), but not with CO(2) assimilation. Peak leaf production of savanna species was in the late dry season, 1 month earlier than for forest species, which suggests a strategy to avoid nutrient losses during leaf expansion due to herbivory or leaching. However, savanna and forest species did not differ in annual branch growth, number of leaves produced per branch, or in timing of leaf fall. Radial growth was tightly coupled to monthly rainfall in forest species whereas the growth of savanna species ceased before the end of the wet season. The cessation of above-ground growth at a time of active photosynthesis may reflect a shift in allocation to roots and reserves. These results contribute to recent studies showing that savanna and forest species represent different functional types and that despite the limiting resources in savanna environments, forest trees that invade the savanna tend to present higher growth rates and larger and denser crowns, which enhance shading and could promote changes in equilibrium of forest-savanna boundaries.},

Three special models in which random jumps occur at the time of events of a Poisson process and admit formal explicit solutions are considered: A) Logistic growth with random disasters having exponentially distributed amplitudes; B) Logistic growth with random disasters causing the removal of a uniformly distributed fraction of the population size; and C) Exponential decay with sudden increases (bonanzas) in the population and with each increase being an exponentially distributed fraction of the current population. Asymptotic and numerical methods are employed to determine the mean extinction time for the population, qualitatively and quantitatively. For Model A, this time becomes exponentially large as the carrying capacity becomes much larger than the mean disaster size. Implications for colonizing species for Model A are discussed. For Models B and C, the practical notion of a small, but positive, effective extinction level is chosen, and in these cases the expected extinction time rises rapidly with population size, yet at less than an exponentially large order.},

Nevertheless, there were some rather abrupt climate changes. One of these changes, the desertification of the Saharan and Arabian region some 46 thousand years ago, was presumably quite important for human society. It could have been the stimulus leading to the foundation of civilizations along the Nile, Euphrat and Tigris rivers. Here we argue that Saharan and Arabian desertification was triggered by subtle variations in the Earth's orbit which were strongly amplified by atmosphere- vegetation feedbacks in the subtropics. The timing of this transition, however, was mainly governed by a global interplay between atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, and vegetation.},

	Abstract = {Models that allow vegetation to respond to and interact with climate provide a unique method for addressing questions regarding feedbacks between the ecosystem and climate in pre-Quaternary time periods. In this paper, we consider how Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs), which have been developed for simulations with present day climate, can be used for paleoclimate studies. We begin with a series of tests in the NCAR Land Surface Model (LSM)-DGVM with Eocene geography to examine (1) the effect of removing C-4 grasses from the available plant functional types in the model; (2) model sensitivity to a change in soil texture; and (3), model sensitivity to a change in the value of pCO(2), used in the photosynthetic rate equations. The tests were designed to highlight some of the challenges of using these models and prompt discussion of possible improvements. We discuss how lack of detail in model boundary conditions, uncertainties in the application of modem plant functional types to paleoflora simulations, and inaccuracies in the model climatology used to drive the DGVM can affect interpretation of model results. However, we also review a number of DGVM features that can facilitate understanding of past climates and offer suggestions for improving paleo-DGVM studies. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

@article{pound_tortonian_2011,
	Abstract = {For the Tortonian age of the Miocene Epoch (11.6-7.25 Ma) we present a global palaeobotanical and palaeoecologically-based vegetation dataset, combined with a best-fit Late Miocene climate-vegetation model experiment to create an advanced global data-model hybrid biome reconstruction. This new palaeoecological database and global vegetation reconstruction can be used both for the purposes of validating future palaeoclimate model simulations, as well as a land cover dataset to initialise palaeoclimate modelling experiments. Our Tortonian reconstruction shows significant changes in the distribution of vegetation compared to modern natural vegetation. For example in contrast to the modern scenario in the Northern Hemisphere, boreal forests reached 80 degrees N and temperate forests were present above 60 N. Warm-temperate forests covered much of Europe, coastal North America and South-East Asia. Our reconstruction shows a spread of temperate savanna in central USA, the Middle East and on the Tibetan Plateau. Evidence for arid deserts is sparse, with the exception of the Atacama region (South America). Areas that exhibit arid desert today in the Tortonian were instead covered by shrublands, grasslands, savannas and woodlands. The extent of tropical forests in South America was likely reduced but expanded in the Indian sub-continent and East Africa. This pattern of global vegetation in the Late Miocene suggests a warmer and wetter world, which is supported by the pattern of climate anomalies predicted by our best-fit palaeoclimate-vegetation model experiment. Global mean annual temperature may have been as much as 4.5 degrees C higher than present day with many regions experiencing higher than modern amounts of precipitation over the annual cycle. The pattern of temperature and precipitation change reconstructed palaeobotanically, and predicted within our climate model experiment, infers a global forcing agent on Tortonian climate (e.g. such as elevated concentrations of greenhouse gases) to explain the observed and modelled climate anomalies. This is in contrast to current proxy records of Tortonian atmospheric CO(2) which range from Last Glacial Maximum to mid-20th Century levels. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{silvertown_plant_2004,
	Abstract = {How large numbers of competing plant species manage to coexist is a major unresolved question in community ecology. The classical explanation, that each species occupies its own niche, seems at first unlikely because most plants require the same set of resources and acquire these in a limited number of ways. However, recent studies, although few in number and incomplete in many ways, do suggest that plants segregate along various environmental niche axes, including gradients of light, soil moisture and root depth, and that partitioning of soil nutrients occurs, possibly through the mediation of microbial symbionts, some of which are more species specific than was previously thought. Although it is unlikely that niche separation along environmental axes is the only mechanism of coexistence in any large community, the evidence now suggests that it plays a more significant role than has been previously appreciated. More research into the consequences of various known tradeoffs is likely to uncover further cases of niche separation facilitating coexistence.},

In this paper, we present a fully seasonal rainfall model that produces vegetation patterns found in nature by including the natural adaptation of plants to scarcity of water and the consequent seasonal variation in their growth and metabolic rate. We present results for the mean-field and spatially extended versions of the model. We find that the patterns depend on the duration of the wet season even with fixed total annual precipitation (PPT) showing how seasonality affects spatial self-organization. We observe that the productivity can vary for fixed PPT as a function of the duration thereby providing another source of observed variations. We compute the maximum vegetation cover as function of PPT and find that the behavior is consistent with observations. We comment on the implications for regime shifts due to increased interannual fluctuations caused by climatic changes. Our specific model calculations provide more general conclusions for ecosystems with competition for scarce resources due to seasonal variations in the resource, especially for self-organization and productivity.

	Abstract = {In this study, we analyze the complexity of plant spatial patterns and diversity along a successional gradient resulting from grazing disturbance in four characteristic ecosystems of the Mediterranean region. Grazing disturbance include not only defoliation by animals, but also associated disturbances as animal trampling, soil compaction, and mineralization by deposition of urine and feces. The results show that woodland and dense matorral are more resistant to species loss than middle dense and scattered matorral, or grassland. Information fractal dimension declined as we moved from a dense to a discontinuous matorral, increasing as we moved to a more scattered matorral and a grassland. In all studied cases, the characteristic species of the natural vegetation declined in frequency and organization with grazing disturbance. Heliophyllous species and others with postrate or rosette twigs increased with grazing pressure, particularly in dense matorral. In the more degraded ecosystem, only species with well-adapted traits, e.g., buried buds or unpalatable qualities showed a clear increase with grazing. Indeed, the homogeneity of species distribution within the plant community declined monotonically with grazing impact. Conversely, the spatial organization of the characteristic plants of each community increased in the better-preserved areas, being also related to the sensitivity of the species to grazing impact. The degree of autocorrelation of plant spatial distribution at the species level and the information fractal dimension at the community level allow us to quantify the degree of degradation of natural communities and to determine the sensitivity of key species to disturbance.

We consider dynamic stochastic models with general and heterogeneous bequest tastes and labor productivities. We limit ourselves to simple but realistic linear or two-bracket tax structures to obtain tractable formulas. We show that long-run optimal inheritance tax rates can always be expressed in terms of aggregate earnings and bequest elasticities with respect to tax rates, distributional parameters, and social preferences for redistribution. Those results carry over with tractable modifications to (a) the case with social discounting (instead of steady-state welfare maximization), (b) the case with partly accidental bequests, (c) the standard Barro--Becker dynastic model. The optimal tax rate is positive and quantitatively large if the elasticity of bequests to the tax rate is low, bequest concentration is high, and society cares mostly about those receiving little inheritance. We propose a calibration using micro-data for France and the United States. We find that, for realistic parameters, the optimal inheritance tax rate might be as large as 50\%--60\%---or even higher for top bequests, in line with historical experience.},

	Abstract = {In rainforests, trunk size, strength, crown position, and geometry of a tree affect light interception and the likelihood of mechanical failure. Allometric relationships of tree diameter, wood density, and crown architecture vs. height are described for a diverse range of rainforest trees in Brunei, northern Borneo. The understory species follow a geometric model in their diameter-height relationship (slope, beta = 1.08), while the stress-elasticity models prevail (beta = 1.27-1.61) for the midcanopy and canopy/emergent species. These relationships changed with ontogeny, especially for the understory species. Within species, the tree stability safety factor (SSF) and relative crown width decreased exponentially with increasing tree height. These trends failed to emerge in across-species comparisons and were reversed at a common (low) height. Across species, the relative crown depth decreased with maximum potential height and was indistinguishable at a common (low) height. Crown architectural traits influence SSF more than structural property of wood density. These findings emphasize the importance of applying a common reference size in comparative studies and suggest that forest trees (especially the understory group) may adapt to low light by having deeper rather than wider crowns due to an efficient distribution and geometry of their foliage.},

@article{matthews_proportionality_2009,
	Abstract = {The global temperature response to increasing atmospheric CO2 is often quantified by metrics such as equilibrium climate sensitivity and transient climate response(1). These approaches, however, do not account for carbon cycle feedbacks and therefore do not fully represent the net response of the Earth system to anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Climate-carbon modelling experiments have shown that: (1) the warming per unit CO2 emitted does not depend on the background CO2 concentration(2); (2) the total allowable emissions for climate stabilization do not depend on the timing of those emissions(3-5); and (3) the temperature response to a pulse of CO2 is approximately constant on timescales of decades to centuries(3,6-8). Here we generalize these results and show that the carbon-climate response (CCR), defined as the ratio of temperature change to cumulative carbon emissions, is approximately independent of both the atmospheric CO2 concentration and its rate of change on these timescales. From observational constraints, we estimate CCR to be in the range 1.0-2.1 degrees C per trillion tonnes of carbon (Tt C) emitted (5th to 95th percentiles), consistent with twenty-first-century CCR values simulated by climate-carbon models. Uncertainty in land-use CO2 emissions and aerosol forcing, however, means that higher observationally constrained values cannot be excluded. The CCR, when evaluated from climate-carbon models under idealized conditions, represents a simple yet robust metric for comparing models, which aggregates both climate feedbacks and carbon cycle feedbacks. CCR is also likely to be a useful concept for climate change mitigation and policy; by combining the uncertainties associated with climate sensitivity, carbon sinks and climate-carbon feedbacks into a single quantity, the CCR allows CO2-induced global mean temperature change to be inferred directly from cumulative carbon emissions.},

	Abstract = {1 Advances in dynamic ecosystem modelling have made a;lumber of different approaches to vegetation dynamics possible. Here we compare two models representing contrasting degrees of abstraction of the processes governing dynamics in real vegetation. 2 Model (a) (GUESS) simulates explicitly growth and competition among individual plants. Differences in crown structure (height, depth, area and LAI) influence relative light uptake by neighbours. Assimilated carbon is allocated individually by each plant to its leaf, fine root and sapwood tissues. Carbon allocation and turnover of sapwood to heartwood in turn govern height and diameter growth. 3 Model (b) (LPJ) incorporates a 'dynamic global vegetation model' (DGVM) architecture, simulating growth of populations of plant functional types (PFTs) over a grid cell, integrating individual-level processes over the proportional area (foliar projective cover, FPC) occupied by each PFT. Individual plants are not simulated, but are replaced by explicit parameterizations of their growth and interactions. 4 The models are identical in their representation of core physiological and biogeochemical processes. Both also use the same set of PFTs, corresponding to the major woody plant groups in Europe, plus a grass type. 5 When applied at a range of locations, broadly spanning climatic variation within Europe, both models successfully predicted PFT composition and succession within modern natural vegetation. However, the individual-based model performed better in areas where deciduous and evergreen types coincide, and in areas subject to pronounced seasonal water deficits, which would tend to favour grasses over drought-intolerant trees. 6 Differences in model performance could be traced to their treatment of individual-level processes, in particular light competition and stress-induced mortality. 7 Our results suggest that an explicit individual-based approach to vegetation dynamics may be an advantage in modelling of ecosystem structure and function at the resolution required for regional-to continental-scale studies.},

	Abstract = {The effect of soil water content on efflux of CO 2 from soils has been described by linear, logarithmic, quadratic, and parabolic functions of soil water expressed as matric potential, gravimetric and volumetric water content, water holding capacity, water-filled pore space, precipitation indices, and depth to water table. The effects of temperature and water content are often statistically confounded. The objectives of this study are: (1) to analyze seasonal variation in soil water content and soil respiration in the eastern Amazon Basin where seasonal temperature variation is minor; and (2) to examine differences in soil CO 2 emissions among primary forests, secondary forests, active cattle pastures, and degraded cattle pastures. Rates of soil respiration decreased from wet to dry seasons in all land uses. Grasses in the active cattle pasture were productive in the wet season and senescent in the dry season, resulting in the largest seasonal amplitude of CO 2 emissions, whereas deep-rooted forests maintained substantial soil respiration during the dry season. Annual emissions were 2.0, 1.8, 1.5, and 1.0 kg C m -2 yr -1 for primary forest, secondary forest, active pasture, and degraded pasture, respectively. Emissions of CO 2 were correlated with the logarithm of matric potential and with the cube of volumetric water content, which are mechanistically appropriate functions for relating soil respiration at below-optimal water contents. The parameterization of these empirical functions was not consistent with those for a temperate forest. Relating rates of soil respiration to water and temperature measurements made at some arbitrarily chosen depth of the surface horizons is simplistic. Further progress in defining temperature and moisture functions may require measurements of temperature, water content and CO 2 production for each soil horizon.},

	Abstract = {While the complexity of ecological simulation models has increased along with advances in computer hardware, recent reviews have concluded that such complex models have generally not fulfilled their potential for advancing ecological understanding. This state of affairs is partially the result of little attention being given to methodological issues for developing simulation models. This paper presents one methodology for developing models of complex systems. The first part of this methodology places the modeling process in the context of general research planning and thus emphasizes the process of synthesis-combining the constituent pieces of knowledge into a unified description of the entities and processes comprising the system to be modeled. The second methodological step involves operationalizing this synthetic description into a composition of smaller models specified over three scalar hierarchical levels. The hierarchical structure of the decomposition also structures the explanations given about system behaviors in that the "mechanism" for a behavior arises at the lower levels while its "purpose" is found at higher levels. The third part of the methodology involves using model assessment to explicitly establish the veracity of the links between the implemented model, the model design specification, and the synthesis. The veracity of these links are established by demonstrating: (i) that the model has been built correctly relative to the model design (verification), (ii) that the light model has been built as judged by the behaviors of the model components across the hierarchical levels (validation), and (iii) that the assessment criteria used are credible for judging model adequacy for the stated modeling objectives (critique). By creating confidence in the mapping between the model implementation and synthesis, the assessment process enables confidence in the explanations given for model behaviors and the theoretical understanding expressed in the synthesis. Alternatively, the failure of the model to satisfy assessment criteria may necessitate a reformulation of the understanding on which the model is based. Regardless of which possibility occurs, because the reasons for model behaviors can be mapped back to the synthesis, ecological understanding is advanced. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {Contemporary climate change is characterized both by increasing mean temperature and increasing climate variability such as heat waves, storms, and floods. How populations and communities cope with such climatic extremes is a question central to contemporary ecology and biodiversity conservation. Previous work has shown that species diversity can affect ecosystem functioning and resilience. Here, we show that genotypic diversity can replace the role of species diversity in a species-poor coastal ecosystem, and it may buffer against extreme climatic events. In a manipulative field experiment, increasing the genotypic diversity of the cosmopolitan seagrass Zostera marina enhanced biomass production, plant density, and faunal abundance, despite near-lethal water temperatures due to extreme warming across Europe. Net biodiversity effects were explained by genotypic complementarity rather than by selection of particularly robust genotypes. Positive effects on invertebrate fauna suggest that genetic diversity has second-order effects reaching higher trophic levels. Our results highlight the importance of maintaining genetic as well as species diversity to enhance ecosystem resilience in a world of increasing uncertainty.

	Abstract = {Researchers from the U.S. Geological Survey, University of Nebraska-Lincoln and the European Commission's Joint Research Centre, Ispra, Italy produced a 1 km resolution global land cover characteristics database for use in a wide range of continental- to global-scale environmental studies. This database provides a unique view of the broad patterns of the biogeographical and ecoclimatic diversity of the global land surface, and presents a detailed interpretation of the extent of human development. The project was carried out as an International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme, Data and Information Systems (IGBP-DIS) initiative. The IGBP DISCover global land cover product is an integral component of the global land cover database. DISCover includes 17 general land cover classes defined to meet the needs of IGBP core science projects. A formal accuracy assessment of the DISCover data layer will be completed in 1998. The 1 km global land cover database was developed through a continent-by-continent unsupervised classification of 1 km monthly Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) composites covering 1992-1993. Extensive post-classification stratification was necessary to resolve spectral/temporal confusion between disparate land cover types. The complete global database consists of 961 seasonal land cover regions that capture patterns of land cover, seasonality and relative primary productivity. The seasonal land cover regions were aggregated to produce seven separate land cover data sets used for global environmental modelling and assessment. The data sets include IGBP DISCover, U.S. Geological Survey Anderson System, Simple Biosphere Model, Simple Biosphere Model 2, Biosphere Atmosphere Transfer Scheme, Olson Ecosystems and Running Global Remote Sensing Land Cover. The database also includes all digital sources that were used in the classification. The complete database can be sourced from the website: http://edcwww.cr.usgs.gov/landdaac/glcc/glcc.html.},

	Abstract = {An optimal strategy of stomatal control during a drought period, in plants adapted to a humid climate, is derived by maximizing the photosynthetic production luring the expected duration of drought. The expected duration of drought is calculated from the probability that rain occurs during a certain period, which is assumed constant. The underlying plant model describes photosynthetic production and the consumption of water from the soil, with a given initial soil water content. Water is consumed through transpiration at a rate dependent on water vapour deficit, temperature and stomatal conductance and carbon is assimilated at a rare dependent on light intensity and stomatal conductance. The optimization problem is solved with driving variables and the probability of rain corresponding to a Fenno-Scandian climate. The resulting optimal stomatal control consists of two processes with different time constants: (1) daily variation depending on the driving variables, and (2) a declining trend as a function of the initial soil water content and the probability of rain. The result allows for a physical interpretation of the so-called 'cost of water' used in similar optimization studies. An approximate model is derived from the optimal solution, such that the 'cost of water' is a function of the soil water content. (C) 1996 Annals of Botany Company},

@article{jobbagy_vertical_2000,
	Abstract = {As the largest pool of terrestrial organic carbon, soils interact strongly with atmospheric composition, climate, and land cover change. Our capacity to predict and ameliorate the consequences of global change depends in part on a better understanding of the distributions and controls of soil organic carbon (SOC) and how vegetation change may affect SOC distributions with depth. The goals of this paper are (1) to examine the association of SOC content with climate and soil texture at different soil depths; (2) to test the hypothesis that vegetation type, through patterns of allocation, is a dominant control on the vertical distribution of SOC; and (3) to estimate global SOC storage to 3 m, including an analysis of the potential effects of vegetation change on soil carbon storage. We based our analysis on {\textgreater}2700 soil profiles in three global databases supplemented with data for climate, vegetation, and land use. The analysis focused on mineral soil layers. Plant functional types significantly affected the vertical distribution of SOC. The percentage of SOC in the top 20 cm (relative to the first meter) averaged 33\%, 42\%, and 50\% for shrublands, grasslands, and forests, respectively. In shrublands, the amount of SOC in the second and third meters was 77\% of that in the first meter; in forests and grasslands, the totals were 56\% and 43\%, respectively. Globally, the relative distribution of SOC with depth had a slightly stronger association with vegetation than with climate, but the opposite was true for the absolute amount of SOC. Total SOC content increased with precipitation and clay content and decreased with temperature. The importance of these controls switched with depth, climate dominating in shallow layers and clay content dominating in deeper layers, possibly due to increasing percentages of slowly cycling SOC fractions at depth. To control for the effects of climate on vegetation, we grouped soils within climatic ranges and compared distributions for vegetation types within each range. The percentage of SOC in the top 20 cm relative to the first meter varied from 29\% in cold arid shrublands to 57\% in cold humid forests and, for a given climate, was always deepest in shrublands, intermediate in grasslands, and shallowest in forests (P {\textless} 0.05 in all cases). The effect of vegetation type was more important than the direct effect of precipitation in this analysis. These data suggest that shoot/root allocations combined with vertical root distributions, affect the distribution of SOC with depth. Global SOC storage in the top 3 m of soil was 2344 Pg C, or 56\% more than the 1502 Pg estimated for the first meter (which is similar to the total SOC estimates of 1500--1600 Pg made by other researchers). Global totals for the second and third meters were 491 and 351 Pg C, and the biomes with the most SOC at 1--3 m depth were tropical evergreen forests (158 Pg C) and tropical grasslands/savannas (146 Pg C). Our work suggests that plant functional types, through differences in allocation, help to control SOC distributions with depth in the soil. Our analysis also highlights the potential importance of vegetation change and SOC pools for carbon sequestration strategies.},

One of the likely causes is a failure to re-examine and change if necessary the theoretical basis of assessment, in line with developing understanding of ecological processes. The concept of thresholds of environmental change appears to provide a reasonable alternative in some circumstances to the concepts of gradual retrogression and secondary succession which are currently accepted. I suggest that environmental change can be discontinuous, with thresholds between alternative states. Once a threshold is crossed to a more degraded state, the former state cannot be attained without significant management effort, such as prescribed burning, ploughing, or herbicide application, rather than simple grazing control. Examination of data from extensive monitoring programs and from a study of grazing impact, as well as more general sources of information, indicates that thresholds of change may be identifiable in arid rangelands. A practical means of monitoring proximity to thresholds is available and, with the aid of multivariate analysis, the effects of spatial variability and season can be separated from those of management. The potential of this approach deserves investigation in a wider variety of environments.},

@article{daly_dynamic_2000,
	Abstract = {The objective of this study was to simulate dynamically the response of a complex landscape, containing forests, savannas, and grasslands, to potential climate change. Thus, it was essential to simulate accurately the competition for light and water between trees and grasses. Accurate representation of water competition requires simulating the appropriate vertical root distribution and soil water content. The importance of different rooting depths in structuring savannas has long been debated. In simulating this complex landscape, we examined alternative hypotheses of tree and grass vertical root distribution and the importance of fire as a disturbance, as they influence savanna dynamics under historical and changing climates. MCl, a new dynamic vegetation model, was used to estimate the distribution of vegetation and associated carbon and nutrient fluxes for Wind Cave National Park, South Dakota, USA. MCl consists of three linked modules simulating biogeography, biogeochemistry, and fire disturbance. This new tool allows us to document how changes in rooting patterns may affect production, fire frequency, and whether or not current vegetation types and life-form mixtures can be sustained at the same location or would be replaced by others. Because climate change may intensify resource deficiencies, it will probably affect allocation of resources to roots and their distribution through the soil profile. We manipulated the rooting depth of two life-forms, trees and grasses, that are competing for water. We then assessed the importance of variable rooting depth on ecosystem processes and vegetation distribution by running MCl for historical climate (1895-1994) and a GCM-simulated future scenario (1995-2094). Deeply rooted trees caused higher tree productivity, lower grass productivity, and longer fire return intervals. When trees were shallowly rooted, grass productivity exceeded that of trees even if total grass biomass was only one-third to one-fourth that of trees. Deeply rooted grasses developed extensive root systems that increased N uptake and, the input of litter into soil organic matter pools. Shallowly rooted grasses produced smaller soil carbon pools. Under the climate change scenario, NPP and live biomass increased for grasses and decreased for trees, and total soil organic matter decreased. Changes in the size of biogeochemical pools produced by the climate change scenario were overwhelmed by the range of responses across the four rooting configurations. Deeply rooted grasses grew larger than shallowly rooted ones, and deeply rooted trees outcompeted grasses for resources. In both historical and future scenarios, fire was required for the coexistence of trees and grasses when deep soil water was available to trees. Consistent changes in fire frequency and intensity were simulated during the climate change scenario: more fires occurred because higher temperatures resulted in decreased fuel moisture. Fire also increased in the deeply rooted grass configurations because grass biomass, which serves as a fine fuel source, was relatively high.},

C-4 grassy biomes cover vast areas that are warm enough and wet enough to support closed forests. The extent of this climate mismatch has been revealed by physiologically based global vegetation simulations and by large empirical data sets. Reasons for the existence of grassy biomes have long been debated, polarized into bottom-up (resources) or top-down (fire,herbivory) arguments. Recent studies indicate that both are important, especially in suppressing woody recruits. Grasses are formidable competitors below ground, create highly flammable fuels, and can support large herbivore densities. The net effect on trees is rare and episodic recruitment of adults in tree-fall gaps. The implication is that ecosystem structure and function depend on demographic transitions. Tree cover is increasing and grass/forest boundaries are changing. These changes can have large feedbacks to the earth-atmosphere system. Though progress has been made, there is still great uncertainty in predicting the future of C-4 grassy biomes.},

In this study a semi-arid predator-prey grazing system is taken as an example and optimal, model based, harvesting rates for the herbivore population are presented that allow survival of both herbivores and grasses during long dry periods without precipitation. Recovery to a maximum sustainable yield is achieved in the next rain season under the assumption of model validity. Optimal control theory is utilized in this example as the principal method of solution. Both analytical and numerical issues of the solution method and obtained solutions are discussed. Survival of the system is possible if the pastoralist is willing to decrease his population considerably once the dry period has set in. The social willingness, necessary to implement these management strategies, can be interpreted in terms of a discount rate in the current value Hamiltonian associated with the dynamical grazing system. The example is worked out in more detail and dynamical solutions for two discount rates are presented. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The possible effects of climate change on the advance of the tree line are considered. As temperature, elevated CO2 and nitrogen deposition co-vary. it is impossible to disentangle their impacts without performing experiments. However. it does seem very unlikely that photosynthesis per se and, by implication. factors that directly influence photosynthesis. such as elevated CO2, will be as important as those factors which influence the capacity of the tree to use the products of photosynthesis, such as temperature. Moreover, temperature limits growth more severely than it limits photosynthesis over the temperature range 5-20 degreesC. If it is assumed that growth and reproduction are controlled by temperature, a rapid advance of the tree line would be predicted, Indeed, some authors have provided photographic evidence and remotely sensed data that suggest this is, in fact, occurring. In regions inhabited by grazing animals, the advance of the tree line will be curtailed, although growth of trees below the tree line will of course increase substantially.

	Abstract = {The effects of neighbours on the growth of individual plants are fundamental to dynamics in plant populations and can be described by means of mathematical functions, so-called competition kernels, in formal spatiotemporal models. Little is known about the form and components such functions should have. We evaluate some properties of kernel functions using data on the growth of Arabidopsis thaliana plants in replicated, even-aged stands of many individuals. Because of the essential non-independence of plant growth in stands, we employed a Bayesian hierarchical modelling approach to estimate values and uncertainties of kernel parameters in location-dependent models of interacting plants. During the experiment plant size and a simple measure of neighbourhood crowding became strongly correlated, plants tending to be small where local crowding was intense, indicating that local competition was an important process in the growth of the plants. Competitive interactions between plants of different sizes were strongly asymmetric, the larger individual acquiring a disproportionately greater share of resources. Competition increased with plant size and attenuated rapidly at distances of a few centimetres, but the exact shape of the attenuation function was less important. Kernel functions with the same kind of structural features were similar in their predictive ability. However, a simple zone-of-influence model, based on overlap of pairs of individuals, with competition favouring the larger individual, was arguably the most parsimonious. Neighbourhood competition in stands of even-aged plants may be successfully captured with relatively simple kernel functions. The results should inform and enhance the formal theory of spatiotemporal plant population and community dynamics. Bayesian hierarchical modelling is a powerful tool with which to analyse complex, spatially dependent data, and has potential as a widely applicable statistical approach for plant ecology.},

@article{bond_fire_1995,
	Abstract = {Changes in plant population size are usually attributed to exogenous factors such as drought or herbivore outbreaks. However, in theory, populations may oscillate from endogenous density-dependent causes alone. Under some conditions these oscillations are very irregular and are called chaos. There are very few examples of endogenous oscillations in plants and these are controversial. Large fluctuations in population size occur after fins in many species of Proteaceae in South African and Australian shrublands. These non-sprouting species form single-aged cohorts with recruitment dating from the last fire. Variation in cohort size has usually been attributed to exogenous factors, especially the length of the fire interval. fire season, and post-burn weather conditions. We studied the importance of endogenous density-dependence in generating population oscillations in these proteoid shrubs. Using a variety of approaches, we show that density-dependent reduction in fecundity may lead to endogenous oscillations in some species. We explore the ''seeds of chaos'' by defining attributes of species and populations most likely to generate endogenous oscillations. Finally, we note the implications of the phenomenon for research in, and management of, these systems.},

Models of this kind are often used to describe populations with selective switching between alternative habitats or diets or to mimic the evolution of an exploited resource where harvesting is forbidden when the resource is below a prescribed threshold. The analysis is carried out by performing the bifurcation analysis of the model with respect to two parameters. A relatively simple method, called the puzzle method, is proposed to construct the complete bifurcation diagram step-by-step.

	Abstract = {1. Ecosystem services (ES) lie at the core of the interactions among humans and ecosystems. Fundamental understanding of the ecological mechanisms underlying the simultaneous provision of multiple ES has been lagging behind policy and management needs and stands out as a research priority. In this paper, we focus on interactions between ES resulting from fundamental functional mechanisms.2. Plant diversity contributes significantly to the delivery of ES. Specifically, functional composition strongly determines different ecosystem properties and services. Knowledge on associations and trade-offs among different plant traits is well established, but the consequences for ecosystem functioning and the resulting ability for ecosystems to provide multiple services have only started to be explored. We present a conceptual framework linking environmental change to changes in ecosystem functioning and to changes in ES through plant traits. We explicitly consider the leaf economics and size axes of plant functional variation, and how their responses to key environmental variables are expected to scale-up to ecosystem properties and ES.3. The framework was tested using a structural equation modelling formalism to understand the trait-based mechanisms driving trade-offs in ES in mountain grasslands. Variations along the leaf economics spectrum (LES) towards more exploitative strategies in response to increasing fertility led to a combined increase in several ES valued by local stakeholders, including agronomic value, cultural value and soil water retention. Surprisingly, and contrary to published hypotheses, soil carbon sequestration in the studied subalpine system did not increase at lower fertility which was associated with more conservative plant strategies. Independent variation in LES and height provided alternative pathways to biomass production.4. Synthesis: A trait-based framework can support the understanding and aid the management of multiple ES. We recommend testing this framework in a variety of contexts and at larger scales, using additional trait axes such as wood density or seed size.},

	Abstract = {With increasing height within the crowns of tall trees, leaves tend to become smaller and thicker and shoots shorter. In tall trees, the vertical variation in leaf/shoot morphology is largely driven by water status. Morphological changes associated with increasing height in the crown present static constraints on photosynthesis, such as decreasing light intercepting area relative to leaf mass and decreasing CO 2 diffusion rate inside the leaf. Despite high light availability, leaf-area-based photosynthetic rates at the tops of tall trees tend to be low and this may limit height growth. However, the observed changes in leaf/shoot morphology as well as xylem/leaf anatomy, and crown architecture may compensate for various physiological constraints associated with increasing tree height. Continuous renewal of branches and foliage through epicormic shoot production and the change from hierarchic to polyarchic crown architecture may allow large trees to maintain physiological function and continue to grow.},

The mapping scale is defined by the 1 km spatial resolution of the map grid-cell. In order to realize the product, different sources of satellite data were used, each source providing either a particular parameter of land cover characteristic required by the legend, or mapping a particular land cover class. The map legend is designed both to fit requirements for regional climate modelling and for studies on land cover change. The legend is also compatible with a wider, global, land cover mapping exercise, which seeks to characterize the world's land surface for the year 2000. As a first step, the humid forest domain has been validated using a sample of high-resolution satellite images. The map demonstrates both the major incursions of agriculture into the remaining forest domains and the extensive areas of agriculture, which now dominate South America's grasslands.},

	Abstract = {Plant functional traits vary both along environmental gradients and among species occupying similar conditions, creating a challenge for the synthesis of functional and community ecology. We present a trait-based approach that provides an additive decomposition of species' trait values into alpha and beta components: beta values refer to a species' position along a gradient defined by community-level mean trait values; alpha values are the difference between a species' trait values and the mean of co-occurring taxa. In woody plant communities of coastal California, beta trait values for specific leaf area, leaf size, wood density and maximum height all covary strongly, reflecting species distributions across a gradient of soil moisture availability. Alpha values, on the other hand, are generally not significantly correlated, suggesting several independent axes of differentiation within communities. This trait-based framework provides a novel approach to integrate functional ecology and gradient analysis with community ecology and coexistence theory.},

	Abstract = {For elucidating the mechanisms underlying the ecological pattern formation, ecological systems consisting of autotrophs, predators including omnivorous organisms, and decomposers are theoretically analyzed in terms of several quantities. This analysis reveals that the circular flow of materials driven by organisms is an important measure for the development of ecological systems, although the biomass as well as the numbers of individual types of organisms show variation depending on member organisms. The smaller size of decomposer increasesboth the biomass and the intensity of material cycling, if they decompose thedead bodies of autotrophs at a higher rate than the natural decay constant. However, the increase in these quantities by decomposers is limited in the sense that it is determined by the death rate of autotrophs. On the contrary, predators decrease the biomass in the ecological system but still intensify the material cycling, if the predators capture and digest the prey at a higher rate than the death rate of the latter. These characteristics of the respective types of organisms to intensify the material cycling are significantly observed in the present life world; the larger sizes of plants consisting of cells each covered with a rigid cell wall, active animals with quicker metabolic turnover, and smaller sizes of decomposers such as fungi and eubacteria. Thus, it is proposed that the coexistence of different types of organisms is not a simple result of genome divergence but is directed to intensify the material cycling in a long time scale of evolution.

	Abstract = {The perfect-plasticity approximation (PPA) is an analytically tractable model of forest dynamics, defined in terms of parameters for individual trees, including allometry, growth, and mortality. We estimated these parameters for the eight most common species on each of four soil types in the US Lake states (Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota) by using short-term (≤15-year) inventory data from individual trees. We implemented 100-year PPA simulations given these parameters and compared these predictions to chronosequences of stand development. Predictions for the timing and magnitude of basal area dynamics and ecological succession on each soil were accurate, and predictions for the diameter distribution of 100-year-old stands were correct in form and slope. For a given species, the PPA provides analytical metrics for early-successional performance (H20, height of a 20-year-old open-grown tree) and late-successional performance ({\^Z}*, equilibrium canopy height in monoculture). These metrics predicted which species were early or late successional on each soil type. Decomposing {\^Z}* showed that (i) succession is driven both by superior understory performance and superior canopy performance of late-successional species, and (ii) performance differences primarily reflect differences in mortality rather than growth. The predicted late-successional dominants matched chronosequences on xeromesic (Quercus rubra) and mesic (codominance by Acer rubrum and Acer saccharum) soil. On hydromesic and hydric soils, the literature reports that the current dominant species in old stands (Thuja occidentalis) is now failing to regenerate. Consistent with this, the PPA predicted that, on these soils, stands are now succeeding to dominance by other late-successional species (e.g., Fraxinus nigra, A. rubrum). climate change community ecology SORTIE TASS trade-offs},

@article{kattge_try_2011,
	Abstract = {Plant traits -- the morphological, anatomical, physiological, biochemical and phenological characteristics of plants and their organs -- determine how primary producers respond to environmental factors, affect other trophic levels, influence ecosystem processes and services and provide a link from species richness to ecosystem functional diversity. Trait data thus represent the raw material for a wide range of research from evolutionary biology, community and functional ecology to biogeography. Here we present the global database initiative named TRY, which has united a wide range of the plant trait research community worldwide and gained an unprecedented buy-in of trait data: so far 93 trait databases have been contributed. The data repository currently contains almost three million trait entries for 69 000 out of the world's 300 000 plant species, with a focus on 52 groups of traits characterizing the vegetative and regeneration stages of the plant life cycle, including growth, dispersal, establishment and persistence. A first data analysis shows that most plant traits are approximately log-normally distributed, with widely differing ranges of variation across traits. Most trait variation is between species (interspecific), but significant intraspecific variation is also documented, up to 40\% of the overall variation. Plant functional types (PFTs), as commonly used in vegetation models, capture a substantial fraction of the observed variation -- but for several traits most variation occurs within PFTs, up to 75\% of the overall variation. In the context of vegetation models these traits would better be represented by state variables rather than fixed parameter values. The improved availability of plant trait data in the unified global database is expected to support a paradigm shift from species to trait-based ecology, offer new opportunities for synthetic plant trait research and enable a more realistic and empirically grounded representation of terrestrial vegetation in Earth system models.},

	Abstract = {Leaf attributes of four savanna tree species were measured along a rainfall gradient (1650-950mm per annum) in the Australian monsoon tropics. As the mean annual rainfall decreased, leaf thickness increased for three of these four species. However, a corresponding decrease in leaf density for two species meant that leaf mass per area increased significantly only for one species. Physiological measurements were made during both the wet and dry seasons on comparable stands of vegetation near the extremes and middle of this gradient. Assimilation per unit mass was similar at all three sites but assimilation per leaf area was higher at the drier sites because leaves were thicker with higher mass per area. These results probably reflect reduced tree density and leaf area index at the drier sites, which offsets the lower rainfall, potentially allowing similar rates of assimilation per unit carbohydrate invested in leaves.},

	Abstract = {Non-timber forest products (NTFPs) contribute significantly to a rural household's livelihood in the African semi-arid tropics. This study examines the income from NTFPs and the dependency on these of different socio-economic groups in Northern Benin. Using survey data from 230 households of two villages, we firstly compared incomes of five different ethnic groups being differentiated by their traditional source of livelihood and regional provenance. Secondly, we investigated disparities between three income groups. On average, income from NTFPs accounted for 39\% of total household income and had a strong equalizing effect on it. However, the economic relevance of NTFPs differs between households: Poorer households are relatively more dependent on NTFPs in order to fulfill basic needs than wealthier households. However, the latter extract more NTFPs in quantitative terms and have significantly higher cash returns than poorer ones. This is mainly due to a significant greater land holding. Moreover, our study revealed that net income from NTFPs reflects traditional sources of livelihoods of different ethnic groups. In conclusion, both conservation and development strategies should take into consideration the socio-economic context of different beneficiaries of savanna woodland resources in order to apply appropriate measures to poverty reduction.

	Abstract = {Classic rangeland theory advocates stocking rangelands at relatively low and constant levels. This theory has been labelled inappropriate for savanna rangelands, because savannas are strongly influenced by stochastic processes. Opportunistic strategies that force animal numbers to track available forage have been proposed as an alternative management paradigm. However, no studies have examined whether these opportunistic strategies are sustainable or optimal. We developed a simulation model of a savanna rangeland to identify optimal, sustainable strategies for the management of extensive rangelands. We optimised the utility of agents who are motivated by economic, production or ecological factors under both deterministic and stochastic conditions. In all cases we found that it was optimal to manage the system conservatively and not opportunistically. Moreover, it was optimal to manage more conservatively under stochastic conditions. Key elements of the conservative strategy were to stock at low levels and to use fire to control tree abundance and thereby maintain the system in a grass dominated state. We conclude that opportunistic strategies of range management although intuitively appealing are not optimal.},

@techreport{deininger_asset_1999,
	Abstract = {Policymakers addressing the impact of inequality on growth should be more concerned about households' access to assets - and to the opportunities associated with them - than about the distribution of income. Asset inequality - but not income inequality - has a relatively great negative impact on growth and also reduces the effectiveness of educational interventions.  With the recent resurgence of interest in equity, inequality, and growth, the possibility of a negative relationship between inequality and economic growth has received renewed interest in the literature. Faced with the prospect that high levels of inequality may persist and give rise to poverty traps, policymakers are paying more attention to the distributional implications of macroeconomic policies. Because high levels of inequality may hurt overall growth, policymakers are exploring measures to promote growth and equity at the same time.  How the consequences of inequality are analyzed, along with the possible cures, depends partly on how inequality is measured.  Deininger and Olinto use assets (land) rather than income - and a GMM estimator - to examine the robustness of the relationship between inequality and growth that has been observed in the cross-sectional literature but has been drawn into question by recent studies using panel techniques.  They find evidence that asset inequality - but not income inequality - has a relatively large negative impact on growth.  They also find that a highly unequal distribution of assets reduces the effectiveness of educational interventions.  This means that policymakers should be more concerned about households' access to assets, and to the opportunities associated with them, than about the distribution of income.  Long-term growth might be improved by measures to prevent large jumps in asset inequality - possibly irreversible asset loss because of exogenous shocks - and by policies to facilitate asset accumulation by the poor.  This paper - a product of Rural Development, Development Research Group - is part of a larger effort in the group to examine the determinants and impact of inequality.

@article{heikkinen_methods_2006,
	Abstract = {Potential impacts of projected climate change on biodiversity are often assessed using single-species bioclimatic 'envelope' models. Such models are a special case of species distribution models in which the current geographical distribution of species is related to climatic variables so to enable projections of distributions under future climate change scenarios. This work reviews a number of critical methodological issues that may lead to uncertainty in predictions from bioclimatic modelling. Particular attention is paid to recent developments of bioclimatic modelling that address some of these issues as well as to the topics where more progress needs to be made. Developing and applying bioclimatic models in a informative way requires good understanding of a wide range of methodologies, including the choice of modelling technique, model validation, collinearity, autocorrelation, biased sampling of explanatory variables, scaling and impacts of non-climatic factors. A key challenge for future research is integrating factors such as land cover, direct CO2 effects, biotic interactions and dispersal mechanisms into species-climate models. We conclude that, although bioclimatic envelope models have a number of important advantages, they need to be applied only when users of models have a thorough understanding of their limitations and uncertainties.},

Using the lottery model as an example, we find that local dispersal contributes to coexistence by enhancing the effects of environmental variation on scales longer than typical dispersal distances, which can be characterized solely by the variance of the dispersal kernel. Higher moments of the dispersal kernel are not important.},

	Abstract = {In current models, the ecophysiological effects of CO(2) create both woody thickening and terrestrial carbon uptake, as observed now, and forest cover and terrestrial carbon storage increases that took place after the last glacial maximum (LGM). Here, we aimed to assess the realism of modelled vegetation and carbon storage changes between LGM and the pre-industrial Holocene (PIH). We applied Land Processes and eXchanges (LPX), a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM), with lowered CO(2) and LGM climate anomalies from the Palaeoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP II), and compared the model results with palaeodata. Modelled global gross primary production was reduced by 27-36\% and carbon storage by 550-694 Pg C compared with PIH. Comparable reductions have been estimated from stable isotopes. The modelled areal reduction of forests is broadly consistent with pollen records. Despite reduced productivity and biomass, tropical forests accounted for a greater proportion of modelled land carbon storage at LGM (28-32\%) than at PIH (25\%). The agreement between palaeodata and model results for LGM is consistent with the hypothesis that the ecophysiological effects of CO(2) influence tree-grass competition and vegetation productivity, and suggests that these effects are also at work today.},

Such models typically account for large-scale land-atmosphere feedbacks. However, these models omit local vegetation-environment feedbacks that may be crucial for critical transitions in ecosystems at larger scales. In this viewpoint paper, we propose the hypothesis that, if the balance of feedbacks is positive at all scales, local vegetation-environment feedbacks may trigger a cascade of amplifying effects, propagating from local to large scale, possibly leading to critical transitions in the large-scale climate.

	Abstract = {Warmer and drier climates over Eastern Amazonia have been predicted as a component of climate change during the next 50--100 years. It remains unclear what effect such changes will have on forest--atmosphere exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water, but the cumulative effect is anticipated to produce climatic feedback at both regional and global scales. To allow more detailed study of forest responses to soil drying, a simulated soil drought or `throughfall exclusion' (TFE) experiment was established at a rain forest site in Eastern Amazonia, Brazil, for which time-series sap flow and soil moisture data were obtained. The experiment excluded 50\% of the throughfall from the soil. Sap flow data from the forest plot experiencing normal rainfall showed no limitation of transpiration throughout the two monitored dry seasons. Conversely, data from the TFE showed large dry season declines in transpiration, with tree water use restricted to 20\% of that in the control plot at the peak of both dry seasons. The results were examined to evaluate the paradigm that the restriction on transpiration in the dry season was caused by limitation of soil-to-root water transport, driven by low soil water potential and high soil-to-root hydraulic resistance. This paradigm, embedded in the soil--plant--atmosphere (SPA) model and driven using on-site measurements, provided a good explanation (R2 {\textgreater} 0.69) of the magnitude and timing of changes in sap flow and soil moisture. This model-data correspondence represents a substantial improvement compared with other ecosystem models of drought stress tested in Amazonia. Inclusion of deeper rooting should lead to lower sensitivity to drought than the majority of existing models. Modelled annual GPP declined by 13--14\% in response to the treatment, compared with estimated declines in transpiration of 30--40\%.},

	Abstract = {We explore the effects of asymmetric competition for light on the outcome of interspecific competition in simple models of resource competition. The models assume that species only differ in their allocation of resource to roots and photosynthetic tissues. Previous studies, which assume symmetric competition for light, have found that all two-species equilibria are unstable leading to founder control, and that as species become more similar in their allocation of resources to roots and photosynthetic tissues so the likelihood of founder control is reduced. In contrast when competition for light is asymmetric as species become more similar the likelihood of founder control increases. Vegetative successions in the model can proceed in one of two directions-from nutrient specialist, with a high allocation to roots, to light specialists, with low allocation to roots, or vice versa. Low nutrient, low disturbance habitats tend to have successions running from light specialists to nutrient specialists, whereas high nutrient, high disturbance habitats have successions in the opposite direction. When light competition is symmetric, we demonstrate that only successions from leaf specialists to root specialists can become arrested. In contrast, when light competition is asymmetric either type of succession may be arrested. Hence, asymmetric competition can have important effects on the outcome of inter-specific competition and on ecosystem properties. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.},

@article{craine_reconciling_2005,
	Abstract = {1 The theories of Grime and Tilman are ambitious attempts to unify disparate theories regarding the construction of plants, their interaction with the environment and the assembly of communities. After over two decades of parallel research, their ideas have not been reconciled, hindering progress in understanding the functioning of ecosystems. 2 Grime's theories do not adequately incorporate the importance of non-heterogeneous supplies of nutrients and how these supplies are partitioned over long time scales, are inconsistent regarding the importance of disturbance in nutrient-limited habitats and need to reconsider the carbon economy of shade-tolerant plants. 3 Failure to account for differences between aquatic and terrestrial systems in how resource supplies are partitioned led Tilman to develop a shifting set of theories that have become reduced in mechanistic detail over time. The most recent highlighted the reduction of nutrient concentrations in soil solution, although it can no longer be derived from any viable mechanistic model. The slow diffusion of nutrients in soils means that the reduction of average soil solution nutrient concentrations cannot explain competitive exclusion. 4 Although neither theory, nor a union of the two, adequately characterizes the dynamics of terrestrial plant assemblages, the complementarity in their assumptions serve as an important foundation for future theory and research. 5 Reconciling the approaches of Grime and Tilman leads to six scenarios for competition for nutrients and light, with the outcome of each depending on the ability of plants to pre-empt supplies. Under uniform supplies, pulses or patches, light competition requires leaf area dominance, while nutrient competition requires root length dominance. There are still important basic questions regarding the nature of nutrient supplies that will need to be answered, but recent research brings us closer to a unified set of theories on resource competition.},

We used stable carbon isotope analysis of feces to investigate seasonal and spatial variation in the diets of elephants from Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa. Elephant diets (overall average similar to 35\% grass) are shown to be distinct from those of grazers ({\textgreater} 90\% grass), browsers ({\textless} 5\% grass), and another mixed-feeder, the impala (Aepyceros melampus; similar to 50\% grass). Fecal delta C-13 values Suggest that elephant populations from northern KNP eat more grass (similar to 40\%) during the dry season than (to their Southern Counterparts (similar to 10\%). The wet-season diets of elephants from northern and southern KNP include similar amounts of grass (similar to 50\%), because elephants in tile South, but not in the north, ate significantly more grass during this time. Although habitat differences in KNP appear to account partially for variations in elephant diets, the specific influence of each habitat type on diet selectivity is not clear. The homogeneity of woody vegetation in the north (dominated by Colophospermum mopane "shrubveld") may deter browsing and force elephants in this area to opt for alternative food sources (grass) throughout the seasonal cycle.},

	Abstract = {Biological invasion is increasingly recognized as one of the greatest threats to biodiversity. Using ensemble forecasts from species distribution models to project future suitable areas of the 100 of the world's worst invasive species defined by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, we show that both climate and land use changes will likely cause drastic species range shifts. Looking at potential spatial aggregation of invasive species, we identify three future hotspots of invasion in Europe, northeastern North America, and Oceania. We also emphasize that some regions could lose a significant number of invasive alien species, creating opportunities for ecosystem restoration. From the list of 100, scenarios of potential range distributions show a consistent shrinking for invasive amphibians and birds, while for aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates distributions are projected to substantially increase in most cases. Given the harmful impacts these invasive species currently have on ecosystems, these species will likely dramatically influence the future of biodiversity.},

Recent studies have demonstrated considerable resilience of Amazonian forests to moderate annual drought, but they also show that interactions between deforestation, fire and drought potentially lead to losses of carbon storage and changes in regional precipitation patterns and river discharge. Although the basin-wide impacts of land use and drought may not yet surpass the magnitude of natural variability of hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles, there are some signs of a transition to a disturbance-dominated regime. These signs include changing energy and water cycles in the southern and eastern portions of the Amazon basin.},

Such maps can result from either compilations of observed spatial patterns or from simulations from models that are global in scope. The method is illustrated by comparing global maps resulting from applying a modified Holdridge Life Zone Classification to current climate and several climate change scenarios (CO2 doubling). These scenarios were based on the results,of several different general circulation models (GCMs). The direction of change in simulated vegetation patterns between different GCMs was found to be quite similar for all future projections. Although there were differences in magnitude and extent, all simulations indicate potential for enormous ecological change. The Kappa statistic proved to be a useful and straightforward measure of agreement between the different global vegetation maps. Furthermore, Kappa statistics for individual vegetation zones clearly indicated differences and similarities between those maps. The Kappa statistic was found to be most useful for rank ordering of agreement, both across a series of maps and across the various vegetation zones within a map.},

@article{smallegange_interference_2007,
	Abstract = {In virtually all natural systems, interference competition among individuals is asymmetric. Here, we used game theoretical models on contest behavior to predict how time lost in agonistic interactions could affect strength of interference under asymmetric competition. We hypothesized that interference through time lost in agonistic interactions would result in a greater reduction in available foraging time and overall feeding rate under symmetric competition than under asymmetric competition. We tested this hypothesis for male shore crabs (Carcinus maenas) that foraged on mussels (Mytilus edulis) in an experiment where prey levels were kept constant. We varied absolute size of crabs (juveniles, small adults, large adults), mussel density (4, 16, 32 per 0.25 m2), and competitor size (smaller, equal, larger). Large adults spent more time in aggressive behaviors than juveniles or small adults, possibly because large adults were more persistent in interfering or because large adults were intrinsically more aggressive, as the experiment was conducted in the mating season. When handling prey, crabs mostly avoided competitors, but juveniles and small adults did so more than large adults. When searching for prey, crabs mostly displaced smaller competitors but threatened or avoided size-matched or larger competitors. By avoiding a competitor, the focal crab lost time but the competitor often did not, and this asymmetry in agonistic behavior is not yet incorporated in models on contest behavior. However, overall, negative effects of others were strongest with size-matched competitors, in line with our hypothesis.},

@article{williams_africa_2007,
	Abstract = {The African continent has a large and growing role in the global carbon cycle, with potentially important climate change implications. However, the sparse observation network in and around the African continent means that Africa is one of the weakest links in our understanding of the global carbon cycle. Here, we combine data from regional and global inventories as well as forward and inverse model analyses to appraise what is known about Africa's continental-scale carbon dynamics. With low fossil emissions and productivity that largely compensates respiration, land conversion is Africa's primary net carbon release, much of it through burning of forests. Savanna fire emissions, though large, represent a short-term source that is offset by ensuing regrowth. While current data suggest a near zero decadal-scale carbon balance, interannual climate fluctuations (especially drought) induce sizeable variability in net ecosystem productivity and savanna fire emissions such that Africa is a major source of interannual variability in global atmospheric CO2. Considering the continent's sizeable carbon stocks, their seemingly high vulnerability to anticipated climate and land use change, as well as growing populations and industrialization, Africa's carbon emissions and their interannual variability are likely to undergo substantial increases through the 21st century.},

@article{markesteijn_seedling_2009,
	Abstract = {1. Water availability is the main determinant of species' distribution in lowland tropical forests. Species' occurrence along water availability gradients depends on their ability to tolerate drought. 2. To identify species' traits underlying drought-tolerance we excavated first year seedlings of 62 dry and moist forest tree species at the onset of the dry season. We evaluate how morphological seedling traits differ between forests, and whether functional groups of species can be identified based on trait relations. We also compare seedling traits along independent axes of drought and shade-tolerance to assess a hypothesized trade-off. 3. Seedlings of dry forest species improve water foraging capacity in deep soil layers by an increased below-ground biomass allocation and by having deep roots. They minimize the risk of cavitation by making dense stems, and reduce transpiration by producing less leaf tissue. Moist forest seedlings have large leaf areas and a greater above-ground biomass, to maximize light interception, and long, cheap, branched root systems, to increase water and nutrient capture. 4. Associations among seedling traits reveal three major drought strategies: (i) evergreen drought-tolerant species have high biomass investment in enduring organs, minimize cavitation and minimize transpiration to persist under dry conditions; (ii) drought-avoiding species maximize resource capture during a limited growing season and then avoid stress with a deciduous leaf habit in the dry season; (iii) drought-intolerant species maximize both below-and above-ground resource capture to increase competitiveness for light, but are consequently precluded from dry habitats. 5. We found no direct trade-off between drought-and shade-tolerance, because they depend largely on different morphological adaptations. Drought-tolerance is supported by a high biomass investment to the root system, whereas shade-tolerance is mainly promoted by a low growth rate and low SLA. 6. Synthesis. We conclude that there are three general adaptation strategies of drought-tolerance, which seemingly hold true across biomes and for different life forms. Drought-and shade-tolerance are largely independent from one another, suggesting a high potential for niche differentiation, as species' specialization can occur at different combinations of water and light availability.},

Trees are assumed to be independently and uniformly distributed within a certain area of interaction (a plot). Tree crowns are considered as either vertical or horizontal planar screens (''discrete screens'') of arbitrary form that partially absorb light and that are illuminated by a point source of light. The average vertical light profile is calculated for both crown representations. The results obtained are discussed and are compared with the description traditionally used in forest modeling; the latter considers a tree canopy as a ''solid layer'' for which the light profile is calculated using Lambert-Beer's law of light absorption. The comparison showed that the solid-layer approach underestimates the amount of light available to an individual tree and is less sensitive to changes in the number of trees in the plot than the ''discrete screens'' approach. The paper also discusses an application of the results obtained to population-level dynamical models.},

@article{ehlers_influence_2009,
	Abstract = {Recent elevation reconstructions of the Andean Plateau suggest a rapid 2.5 $\pm$ 1.0 km rise of the central Andes between {\textasciitilde} 10 and 6 Ma. This rapid rise has been attributed to a catastrophic removal of a dense lithospheric mantle root beneath the Andes. However, these findings are based on the assumption that climate did not change during deposition of paleoaltimetry proxies. Here we evaluate South American climate change due to Andean uplift and its influence on interpretations of plateau elevation from climate-sensitive paleoaltimetry data. A series of experiments are presented using the RegCM3 regional general circulation model (RCM) to characterize changes in Andean precipitation amount, surface temperature, and wind direction (vapor source) as a function of changing plateau elevation. Results indicate that South American and Andean climate changed significantly in response to plateau growth. More specifically, rising of the plateau results in up to a 900 mm increase in rainy season (December--January--February) precipitation over the plateau. Plateau uplift also results in a decrease in non-adiabatic surface temperature of up to 6.5 $\,^{\circ}$C (in addition to adiabatic cooling directly related to elevation change through the lapse rate). Finally, the prevailing wind direction and the vapor source for precipitation switches from the South Pacific Ocean to the equatorial Atlantic as plateau elevation increases above ½--¾ of its present-day elevation. Taken together, these changes in paleoclimate would have substantially depleted the oxygen isotopic concentration of paleoprecipitation through the Cenozoic. Unless this climatic effect is taken into consideration, paleoaltimetry reconstructions based on stable isotope methods may overestimate the rapid rise of the Andes by up to several kilometers. We conclude that some or all of the apparent rapid rise of the Andean Plateau from paleoaltimetry data could be an artifact of large changes in paleoclimate.},

Understanding how animal populations react to such events is thus crucial for addressing future challenges for wildlife management and conservation. We explored how gender, age, mother's experience and family group characteristics determined calf survival in an elephant population during a severe drought in Tanzania in 1993. Young males were particularly sensitive to the drought and calf loss was higher among young mothers than among more experienced mothers. We also report high variability in calf mortality between different family groups, with family groups that remained in the National Park suffering heavy calf loss, compared with the ones that left the Park. This study highlights how severe droughts can dramatically affect early survival of large herbivores and suggests that extreme climatic events might act as a selection force on vertebrate populations, allowing only individuals with the appropriate behaviour and/or knowledge to survive.},

	Abstract = {Intraspecific competitive behaviours were studied in a reintroduced population of Griffon Vultures Gyps fulvus in order to describe the pattern of competition between ages and sexes, assess the effect of reintroduction on competitive behaviour, and study the potential consequences of food management on competition. There was no evidence for a difference in feeding or display rates between age classes. However interaction rates, aggressiveness and dominance were higher in old adults than in the other age classes. No difference in the pattern of competition was found between sexes. There was no difference in the competitive ability (feeding rate and dominance) of reintroduced and wild-bred individuals. Feeding rates increased with resource availability. Group size also increased with food mass, but was lower than the theoretical maximum number of birds. This may be evidence of competition by interference where some individuals are able to increase their feeding rate by the exclusion of others. An increase in both the number of carcasses and the number of feeding sites is thus recommended to induce dispersal and reduce this competition.},

Under the IS92a ``business as usual'' emissions scenario CO 2 concentrations reached about 980?ppmv by 2100, which is about 280?ppmv higher than when these feedbacks were ignored. The major contribution to the increased CO 2 arose from reductions in soil carbon because global warming is assumed to accelerate respiration. However, there was also a lesser contribution from an alarming loss of the Amazonian rainforest. This paper describes the phenomenon of Amazonian forest dieback under elevated CO 2 in the Hadley Centre climate-carbon cycle model.},

	Abstract = {In the enriched carbon dioxide atmosphere expected in the next century, many, species of herbivorous insects will confront less nutritious host plants that will induce both lengthened larval developmental times and greater mortality The limited data currently available suggest that the effect of increased atmospheric CO2 on herbivory will be nor only highly species-specific brit also specific to each insect-plant system. Several scenarios can be predicted however. (1) local extinctions will occur; (2) the endangered species status as well as the pest status of some insect species will change; (3) geographic distributions for some insect species will shift with host-plant ranges; and (4) changes in the population dynamics of affected insect species will influence their interactions with other insects and plants. For insect conservation purposes, it is critical to begin long-term studies on the effects of enhanced CO2 levels on insect populations. An analysis of the available literature indicates that many orders containing insect species important for ecosystem conservation, and even those important as agricultural or medical pests, have not been examined. Without a major increase in research on this topic, we will be unprepared for the species changes that will occur, we will lose the opportunity to document just how some insects adapt to elevated CO2 levels, and we will lack the information necessary for effective conservation efforts.},

@article{white_co2_2000,
	Abstract = {A nonequilibrium, dynamic, global vegetation model, Hybrid v4.1, with a subdaily timestep, was driven by increasing CO2 and transient climate output from the UK Hadley Centre GCM (HadCM2) with simulated daily and interannual variability. Three IPCC emission scenarios were used: (i) IS92a, giving 790 ppm CO2 by 2100, (ii) CO2 stabilization at 750 ppm by 2225, and (iii) CO2 stabilization at 550 ppm by 2150. Land use and future N deposition were not included. In the IS92a scenario, boreal and tropical lands warmed 4.5 degrees C by 2100 with rainfall decreased in parts of the tropics, where temperatures increased over 6 degrees C in some years and vapour pressure deficits (VPD) doubled. Stabilization at 750 ppm CO2 delayed these changes by about 100 years while stabilization at 550 ppm limited the rise in global land surface temperature to 2.5 degrees C and lessened the appearance of relatively hot, dry areas in the tropics. Present-day global predictions were 645 PgC in vegetation, 1190 PgC in soils, a mean carbon residence time of 40 years, NPP 47 PgC y(-1) and NEP (the terrestrial sink) about 1 PgC y(-1), distributed at both high and tropical latitudes. With IS92a emissions, the high latitude sink increased to the year 2100, as forest NPP accelerated and forest vegetation carbon stocks increased. The tropics became a source of CO2 as forest dieback occurred in relatively hot, dry areas in 2060-2080. High VPDs and temperatures reduced NPP in tropical forests, primarily by reducing stomatal conductance and increasing maintenance respiration. Global NEP peaked at 3-4 PgC y(-1) in 2020-2050 and then decreased abruptly to near zero by 2100 as the tropical source offset the high-latitude sink. The pattern of change in NEP was similar with CO2 stabilization at 750 ppm, but was delayed by about 100 years and with a less abrupt collapse in global NEP. CO2 stabilization at 550 ppm prevented sustained tropical forest dieback and enabled recovery to occur in favourable years, while maintaining a similar time course of global NEP as occurred with 750 ppm stabilization. By lessening dieback, stabilization increased the fraction of carbon emissions taken up by the land. Comparable studies and other evidence are discussed: climate-induced tropical forest dieback is considered a plausible risk of following an unmitigated emissions scenario.},

@article{davidson_temperature_2006,
	Abstract = {Significantly more carbon is stored in the world's soils-including peatlands, wetlands and permafrost-than is present in the atmosphere. Disagreement exists, however, regarding the effects of climate change on global soil carbon stocks. If carbon stored belowground is transferred to the atmosphere by a warming-induced acceleration of its decomposition, a positive feedback to climate change would occur. Conversely, if increases of plant-derived carbon inputs to soils exceed increases in decomposition, the feedback would be negative. Despite much research, a consensus has not yet emerged on the temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition. Unravelling the feedback effect is particularly difficult, because the diverse soil organic compounds exhibit a wide range of kinetic properties, which determine the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of their decomposition. Moreover, several environmental constraints obscure the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of substrate decomposition, causing lower observed 'apparent' temperature sensitivity, and these constraints may, themselves, be sensitive to climate.},

	Abstract = {The links between plant diversity and ecosystem functioning remain highly controversial. There is a growing consensus, however, that functional diversity, or the value and range of species traits, rather than species numbers per se, strongly determines ecosystem functioning. Despite its importance, and the fact that species diversity is often an inadequate surrogate, functional diversity has been studied in relatively few cases. Approaches based on species richness on the one hand, and on functional traits and types on the other, have been extremely productive in recent years, but attempts to connect their findings have been rare. Crossfertilization between these two approaches is a promising way of gaining mechanistic insight into the links between plant diversity and ecosystem processes and contributing to practical management for the conservation of diversity and ecosystem services.},

@article{beckage_vegetation_2009,
	Abstract = {Savanna models that are based on recurrent disturbances such as fire result in nonequilibrium savannas, but these models rarely incorporate vegetation feedbacks on fire frequency or include more than two states (grasses and trees). We develop a disturbance model that includes vegetation-fire feedbacks, using a system of differential equations to represent three main components of savannas: grasses, fire-tolerant savanna trees, and fire-intolerant forest trees. We investigate the stability of savannas in the presence of positive feedbacks of fire frequency with (1) grasses, (2) savanna trees, and (3) grasses and savanna trees together while also allowing for negative feedbacks of forest trees on fire frequency. We find that positive feedbacks between fire frequency and savanna trees, alone or together with grasses, can stabilize savannas, blocking the conversion of savannas to forests. Negative feedbacks of forest trees on fire frequency shift the range of parameter space that supports savannas, but they do not generally alter our results. We propose that pyrogenic trees that modify characteristics of fire regimes are ecosystem engineers that facilitate the persistence of savannas, generating both threshold fire frequencies with rapid changes in community composition when these thresholds are crossed and hystereses with bistable community states.},

@article{zeppel_drought_2014,
	Abstract = {Many species have the ability to resprout vegetatively after a substantial loss of biomass induced by environmental stress, including drought. Many of the regions characterised by ecosystems where resprouting is common are projected to experience more frequent and intense drought during the 21st Century. However, in assessments of ecosystem response to drought disturbance there has been scant consideration of the resilience and post-drought recovery of resprouting species. Systematic differences in hydraulic and allocation traits suggest that resprouting species are more resilient to drought-stress than nonresprouting species. Evidence suggests that ecosystems dominated by resprouters recover from disturbance more quickly than ecosystems dominated by nonresprouters. The ability of resprouters to avoid mortality and withstand drought, coupled with their ability to recover rapidly, suggests that the impact of increased drought stress in ecosystems dominated by these species may be small. The strategy of resprouting needs to be modelled explicitly to improve estimates of future climate-change impacts on the carbon cycle, but this will require several important knowledge gaps to be filled before resprouting can be properly implemented.},

@article{loarie_elephant_2009,
	Abstract = {As African savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana) become increasingly confined to smaller fragmented landscapes, concern over their potential detrimental impacts on vegetation and biodiversity has increased. Understanding elephant vegetation preferences across relevant spatial and temporal scales is a critical step towards managing protected areas for the persistence of both elephants and biodiversity. To better understand elephant vegetation selection, we fitted 68 elephants with GPS collars across a strong rainfall gradient spanning seven southern African countries over a period of 6 years. We compared elephant locations with remotely-sensed environmental data that measure bi-monthly vegetation greenness across the study area. Elephants consistently seek out greener than expected vegetation throughout the year. Interestingly, they do so by utilizing vegetation with different phenologies and by selecting landscapes when they are greener than their surroundings. We found no differences between dry and wet savannas. These patterns persist even when elephants are constrained by seasonally available water. In the wet season, elephants select seasonally variable landscapes such as open woodlands, shrublands, and grasslands. These landscapes have a lower average annual greenness but become very green for a few months in the wet season. In the dry season, elephants prefer less variable landscapes that are more consistently green year-round such as well-wooded areas and closed woodlands. Because elephants prefer different vegetation types at different times of the year, small homogeneous protected areas may be unsuitable for elephants. Since elephants prefer woody vegetation during the dry season when they are constrained by water, human actions that increase dry season water availability may contribute to detrimental elephant impacts on vegetation and biodiversity.

@article{borner_rainfall_2007,
	Abstract = {Savannas cover the greater part of Africa and Australia and almost half of South America and contribute to the livelihoods of more than 350 million people. With the intensification of land use during the second half of the 20th century, savannas have become increasingly degraded through bush encroachment as a consequence of increased grazing pressure. Research on rangeland dynamics, however, provides contradicting answers with regard to the causes and possible remedies of bush encroachment. In this article we present results from an application of a simulation-optimization model to the case of extensive rangeland management in South Africa. Our model differs from previous approaches in that it explicitly accounts for the influence of stochastic prices and rainfall on economically optimal management decisions. By showing the implications of neglecting price variation and stochasticity in rangeland models we provide new insights with regard to the determinants of bush encroachment and rangeland managers' economic return. We demonstrate that, in the case of South Africa, optimal rangeland management is likely to lead to bush encroachment that eventually makes livestock holding unprofitable. Yet, we identify the costs of fire management to be a limiting factor for managers to counteract bush encroachment and explore the impact of policy measures to reduce fire control costs on the ecological and economic sustainability of livestock holding.},

	Abstract = {Ecologists have used a variety of comparative mensurative and manipulative
experimental approaches to study the biological consequences of habitat fragmentation. In this paper, we evaluate the merits of the two major approaches and offer guidelines for
selecting a design. Manipulative experiments rigorously assess fragmentation effects by
comparing pre- and post-treatment conditions. Yet they are often constrained by a number
of practical limitations, such as the difficulty in implementing large-scale treatments and
the impracticality of measuring the long-term (decades to centuries) responses to the im-
posed treatments. Comparative mensurative studies generally involve substituting space for
time, and without pre-treatment control, can be constrained by variability in ecological
characteristics among different landscapes. These confounding effects can seriously limit
the strength of inferences. Depending on the scale of the study system and how ``landscape''
is defined, both approaches may be limited by the difficulty of replicating at the landscape
scale. Overall, both mensurative and manipulative approaches have merit and can contribute
to the body of knowledge on fragmentation. However, from our review of 134 fragmentation
studies published recently in three major ecological journals, it is evident that most ma-
nipulative and mensurative fragmentation experiments have not provided clear insights into
the ecological mechanisms and effects of habitat fragmentation. We discuss the reasons for
this and conclude with recommendations for improving the design and implementation of
fragmentation experiments.},

In our model, the soil-vegetation-atmosphere dynamics display two stable states for realistic values of the synoptic moisture convergence flux. Starting from low soil moisture and/or low vegetation cover, the system reaches a dry and hot state, whereas it reaches a wet and cool state when starting from higher initial values of soil moisture and of vegetation cover. The role of synoptic perturbations is investigated by inserting a stochastic input of moisture: in this case, a bimodal distribution of soil moisture is obtained. We explore the difference between the dynamics of natural vegetation, capable of adjusting its areal extent to variations in soil moisture, and cultivated vegetation, whose areal extent cannot vary. The model results indicate that the presence of natural vegetation increases the probability of reaching a wet/cool state with respect to the case of cultivated plants.},

	Abstract = {Many aspects of plant water use -- particularly in response to soil drought -- may have as their basis the alteration of hydraulic conductance from soil to canopy. The regulation of plant water potential (Ψ) by stomatal control and leaf area adjustment may be necessary to maximize water uptake on the one hand, while avoiding loss of hydraulic contact with the soil water on the other. Modelling the changes in hydraulic conductance with pressure gradients in the continuum allows the prediction of water use as a function of soil environment and plant architectural and xylem traits. Large differences in water use between species can be attributed in part to differences in their `hydraulic equipment' that is presumably optimized for drawing water from a particular temporal and spatial niche in the soil environment. A number of studies have identified hydraulic limits as the cause of partial or complete foliar dieback in response to drought. The interactions between root:shoot ratio, rooting depth, xylem properties, and soil properties in influencing the limits to canopy water supply can be used to predict which combinations should optimize water use in a given circumstance. The hydraulic approach can improve our understanding of the coupling of canopy processes to soil environment, and the adaptive significance of stomatal behaviour.},

We mapped the total carbon stock in live biomass (above-and belowground), using a combination of data from 4,079 in situ inventory plots and satellite light detection and ranging (Lidar) samples of forest structure to estimate carbon storage, plus optical and microwave imagery (1-km resolution) to extrapolate over the landscape. The total biomass carbon stock of forests in the study region is estimated to be 247 Gt C, with 193 Gt C stored aboveground and 54 Gt C stored belowground in roots. Forests in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia accounted for 49\%, 25\%, and 26\% of the total stock, respectively. By analyzing the errors propagated through the estimation process, uncertainty at the pixel level (100 ha) ranged from +/- 6\% to +/- 53\%, but was constrained at the typical project (10,000 ha) and national ({\textgreater}1,000,000 ha) scales at ca. +/- 5\% and ca. +/- 1\%, respectively. The benchmark map illustrates regional patterns and provides methodologically comparable estimates of carbon stocks for 75 developing countries where previous assessments were either poor or incomplete.},

	Abstract = {Process-based models can be classified into: (a) terrestrial biogeochemical models (TBMs), which simulate fluxes of carbon, water and nitrogen coupled within terrestrial ecosystems, and (b) dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), which further couple these processes interactively with changes in slow ecosystem processes depending on resource competition, establishment, growth and mortality of different vegetation types. In this study, four modelsRHESSys, GOTILWA+, LPJ-GUESS and ORCHIDEErepresenting both modelling approaches were compared and evaluated against benchmarks provided by eddy-covariance measurements of carbon and water fluxes at 15 forest sites within the EUROFLUX project. Overall, model-measurement agreement varied greatly among sites. Both modelling approaches have somewhat different strengths, but there was no model among those tested that universally performed well on the two variables evaluated. Small biases and errors suggest that ORCHIDEE and GOTILWA+ performed better in simulating carbon fluxes while LPJ-GUESS and RHESSys did a better job in simulating water fluxes. In general, the models can be considered as useful tools for studies of climate change impacts on carbon and water cycling in forests. However, the various sources of variation among models simulations and between models simulations and observed data described in this study place some constraints on the results and to some extent reduce their reliability. For example, at most sites in the Mediterranean region all models generally performed poorly most likely because of problems in the representation of water stress effects on both carbon uptake by photosynthesis and carbon release by heterotrophic respiration (R-h). The use of flux data as a means of assessing key processes in models of this type is an important approach to improving model performance. Our results show that the models have value but that further model development is necessary with regard to the representation of the some of the key ecosystem processes.},

	Abstract = {For the Tortonian (Late Miocene, 11 to 7 Ma), we present a model simulation using the atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) ECHAM4 coupled to a mixed-layer (ML) ocean model. The Tortonian simulation with ECHAM4/ML includes an adjusted weaker than present ocean heat transport, a generally lower palaeorography and an appropriate palaeovegetation. We analyse the climatic differences between the Tortonian run and the present-day control experiment, and we validate our Tortonian model results for the mean annual temperature and the annual precipitation with quantitative terrestrial proxy data. Globally, the Tortonian run is slightly warmer (+0.6 degrees C and the global precipitation indicates more humid conditions (+27 mm/a) than the PD control run. Particularly the northern high latitudes are warmer (+3.5 degrees C in the Tortonian simulation which leads to a weaker meridional temperature gradient than today as well as to a reduction of polar sea ice. We attribute the polar warming to the lowering of the Greenland elevation (+20 degrees C in the Miocene and to the effects of the palaeovegetation. The reduced altitude of the Tibetan Plateau causes a warming (+20 degrees C as compared to today and leads to a weaker Asian monsoon in the Tortonian run. For Europe, the mean annual temperature is almost unaffected as compared to today because a cooling effect of the weak palaeoccan heat transport is compensated by the palaeovegetation. When validating our model results, we find that the Tortonian run is largely consistent with quantitative proxy data. However, the high latitudes tend to be generally too cool in the palaeoclimate simulation and the equator-to-pole temperature gradient is too steep as compared to proxy data. For Europe the comparison with proxy data indicates that the Tortonian simulation underestimates the mean annual temperatures, but precipitation patterns are quite consistent between model results and proxy data. Overall, the Tortonian run is quite realistic and hence the model simulation contributes to a better understanding of the relevant climate processes in the Miocene. However, the discrepancies to proxy data demonstrate that we still do not sufficiently understand the Late Miocene climate. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{woodward_global_2004,
	Abstract = {Biomes are areas of vegetation that are characterized by the same life-form. Traditional definitions of biomes have also included either geographical or climatic descriptors. This approach describes a wide range of biomes that can be correlated with characteristic climatic conditions, or climatic envelopes. The application of remote sensing technology to the frequent observation of biomes has led to a move away from the often subjective definition of biomes to one that is objective. Carefully characterized observations of life-form, by satellite, have been used to reconsider biome classification and their climatic envelopes. Five major tree biomes can be recognized by satellites based on leaf longevity and morphology: needleleaf evergreen, broadleaf evergreen, needleleaf deciduous, broadleaf cold deciduous and broadleaf drought deciduous. Observations indicate that broadleaf drought deciduous vegetation grades substantially into broadleaf evergreen vegetation. The needleleaf deciduous biome occurs in the world's coldest climates, where summer drought and therefore a drought deciduous biome are absent. Traditional biome definitions are quite static, implying no change in their life-form composition with time, within their particular climatic envelopes. However, this is not the case where there has been global ingress of grasslands and croplands into forested vegetation. The global spread of grasses, a new super-biome, was probably initiated 30-45 Myr ago by an increase in global aridity, and was driven by the natural spread of the disturbances of fire and animal grazing. These disturbances have been further extended over the Holocene era by human activities that have increased the land areas available for domestic animal grazing and for growing crops. The current situation is that grasses now occur in most, if not all biomes, and in many areas they dominate and define the biome. Croplands are also increasing, defining a new and relatively recent component to the grassland super-biome. In the case of both grassland and croplands, various forms of disturbance, particularly frequent disturbance, lead to continued range extensions of the biomes.},

Summary
We quantified the biomass allocation patterns to leaves, stems and roots in vegetative plants, and how this is influenced by the growth environment, plant size, evolutionary history and competition. Dose--response curves of allocation were constructed by means of a meta-analysis from a wide array of experimental data. They show that the fraction of whole-plant mass represented by leaves (LMF) increases most strongly with nutrients and decreases most strongly with light. Correction for size-induced allocation patterns diminishes the LMF-response to light, but makes the effect of temperature on LMF more apparent. There is a clear phylogenetic effect on allocation, as eudicots invest relatively more than monocots in leaves, as do gymnosperms compared with woody angiosperms. Plants grown at high densities show a clear increase in the stem fraction. However, in most comparisons across species groups or environmental factors, the variation in LMF is smaller than the variation in one of the other components of the growth analysis equation: the leaf area : leaf mass ratio (SLA). In competitive situations, the stem mass fraction increases to a smaller extent than the specific stem length (stem length : stem mass). Thus, we conclude that plants generally are less able to adjust allocation than to alter organ morphology.},

@article{kissling_woody_2010,
	Abstract = {Current methods of assessing climate-induced shifts of species distributions rarely account for species interactions and usually ignore potential differences in response times of interacting taxa to climate change. Here, we used species-richness data from 1005 breeding bird and 1417 woody plant species in Kenya and employed model-averaged coefficients from regression models and median climatic forecasts assembled across 15 climate-change scenarios to predict bird species richness under climate change. Forecasts assuming an instantaneous response of woody plants and birds to climate change suggested increases in future bird species richness across most of Kenya whereas forecasts assuming strongly lagged woody plant responses to climate change indicated a reversed trend, i.e. reduced bird species richness. Uncertainties in predictions of future bird species richness were geographically structured, mainly owing to uncertainties in projected precipitation changes. We conclude that assessments of future species responses to climate change are very sensitive to current uncertainties in regional climate-change projections, and to the inclusion or not of time-lagged interacting taxa. We expect even stronger effects for more specialized plant-animal associations. Given the slow response time of woody plant distributions to climate change, current estimates of future biodiversity of many animal taxa may be both biased and too optimistic.},

The goal of this analysis is to identify those conditions in which engineering leads to population dynamics that are qualitatively different than one would predict using models that incorporate only biotic interactions. We present a simple model coupling an ecosystem engineer and the abiotic environment. We assume that the engineer alters environmental conditions at a rate dependent on engineer density and that the environment decays back to original conditions at an exponential rate. We determine when the feedback to population dynamics through environmental state can lead to altered equilibrium densities, bistability, or runaway growth of the engineer population. The conditions leading to changes in dynamics, such as susceptibility of a system to engineering or alteration of density-dependent and density-independent controls, define cases in which the engineering concept is essential for ecological understanding.},

@article{choat_global_2012,
	Abstract = {Shifts in rainfall patterns and increasing temperatures associated with climate change are likely to cause widespread forest decline in regions where droughts are predicted to increase in duration and severity. One primary cause of productivity loss and plant mortality during drought is hydraulic failure. Drought stress creates trapped gas emboli in the water transport system, which reduces the ability of plants to supply water to leaves for photosynthetic gas exchange and can ultimately result in desiccation and mortality. At present we lack a clear picture of how thresholds to hydraulic failure vary across a broad range of species and environments, despite many individual experiments. Here we draw together published and unpublished data on the vulnerability of the transport system to drought-induced embolism for a large number of woody species, with a view to examining the likely consequences of climate change for forest biomes. We show that 70\% of 226 forest species from 81 sites worldwide operate with narrow ({\textless}1 megapascal) hydraulic safety margins against injurious levels of drought stress and therefore potentially face long-term reductions in productivity and survival if temperature and aridity increase as predicted for many regions across the globe. Safety margins are largely independent of mean annual precipitation, showing that there is global convergence in the vulnerability of forests to drought, with all forest biomes equally vulnerable to hydraulic failure regardless of their current rainfall environment. These findings provide insight into why drought-induced forest decline is occurring not only in arid regions but also in wet forests not normally considered at drought risk.},

@article{wigley_bush_2009,
	Abstract = {This study determined the effects of land-use practice had on the rate and extent of bush encroachment in a mesic savanna in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Changes in woody cover were measured for 1 km(2) sites in areas under communal, commercial and conservation land-use systems for the period between 1937 and 2000. Land users from each area were interviewed to gain the histories of each area and to determine how the changes in woody cover had impacted them and whether anything was being done to counteract the spread of trees and shrubs on their land. Bush encroachment occurred across all three of the land-use types in the 67-year period between 1937 and 2000. The results showed that land-use practice had enormous impacts on the process of bush encroachment. The communal site showed a decrease in grass (21\%) and tree (5\%) cover and an increase in shrub cover (13\%). At the commercial site, there was a considerable decrease in grass cover (46\%) and moderate increase in shrub cover (10\%) and a massive increase in tree cover (36\%). The area under conservation showed a substantial decrease in grass cover (47\%), a slight decrease in shrub cover (19\%) and a massive increase in tree cover (66\%). The perceived causes of these changes were fairly similar amongst the different land users. The changes were mostly not perceived to be a problem for the communal land users. The main advantages mentioned were increased woody resources for building and firewood and increased browse availability. The commercial and conservation land users perceived the changes to have significant negative connotations including the loss of grazing land and biodiversity and secondary invasion of encroached areas by alien plant species. Despite these perceptions, very little has been done to combat bush encroachment in the commercial and conservation land use systems.},

Because the benefits of plant height depend on which other height strategies are present, competition for light can usefully be framed as a game-theoretic problem. The vertical structure of the world's vegetation, which is inefficient for plant growth, can then be understood as the outcome of evolutionary and ecological arms races. In addition, game-theoretic models predict taller vegetation on sites of higher leaf area index, and allocation to reproduction only after an initial period of height growth. However, of 14 game-theoretic models for height reviewed here, only one predicts coexistence of a mix of height strategies, a conspicuous feature of most vegetation. We suggest that game-theoretic models could help account for observed mixtures of height strategies if they incorporated processes for coexistence along spectra of light income and time since disturbance.},

	Abstract = {Carbon allocation within a plant depends on complex rules linking source organs (mainly shoots) and sink organs (mainly roots and fruits). The complexity of these rules comes from both regulations and interactions between various plant processes involving carbon. This paper presents these regulations and interactions, and analyses how agricultural management can influence them. Ecophysiological models of carbon production and allocation are good tools for such analyses. The fundamental bases of these models are first presented, focusing on their underlying processes and concepts. Different approaches are used for modelling carbon economy. They are classified as empirical, teleonomic, driven by source-sink relationships, or based on transport and chemical/biochemical conversion concepts. These four approaches are presented with a particular emphasis on the regulations and interactions between organs and between processes. The role of plant architecture in carbon partitioning is also discussed and the interest of coupling plant architecture models with carbon allocation models is highlighted. As an illustration of carbon allocation models, a model developed for peach trees, describing carbon transfer within the plant, and based on source-sink and Munch transport theory is presented and used for analyzing the link between roots, shoots and reproductive compartments. On this basis, the consequences of fruit load or plant pruning on fruit and vegetative growth can be evaluated.},

The hypothesis that more complex models simulate reality better, but with more sensitivity and less error, is tested. An Index of Complexity is proposed. Improvements in fit of more complex models are weighed against the increase in model sensitivity. A simple index of utility is then proposed for model selection. The index of utility evaluates model sensitivity (response to changes in input) and model error (closeness of simulation to measurement). Model utility is evaluated for several models in two case studies, a simple system involving sorption of metals on sediments, and a more complex system, involving groundwater transport of a hydrophobic contaminant.

	Abstract = {Aim

C4 photosynthesis is an adaptation that maintains efficient carbon assimilation in high-light, high-temperature conditions. Due to the importance of C4 grasses for carbon and surface energy fluxes, numerous models have been proposed to describe their spatial distribution and forecast their responses to climate change. These models often rely on broad climatic predictors (e.g. temperature and precipitation) but fail to integrate other ecologically relevant factors like disturbance and competition, which may modify realized C3/C4 grass distributions. Here, we present a combined evaluation of the contribution of ecological factors and climatic predictors to realized C3/C4 grass distributions. We consider multiple biogeographic regions of North America using a multisource database of over 40,000 vegetation plots.


Location

The conterminous United States of America (USA).


Methods

We identified a comprehensive pool of climatic models in the literature and used information theoretic criteria to select a primary climatic predictor of C3 and C4 grass distributions. Subsequently, the best model was combined with ecological predictors (e.g. fire, tree cover) using a multiple regression framework and tested within eight regions.


Results

Surprisingly, grass-dominated communities across the USA exist largely in C3- or C4-dominated states. Transitions between C3/C4 dominance were best explained by models that integrated temperature and precipitation with ecological factors that varied according to region. For some regions, like Eastern Temperate Forests, local ecological factors were comparable in strength to broad-scale climatic predictors of C3/C4 abundance.


Main conclusion

Local ecological factors modify C3/C4 grass responses to broad-scale climatic drivers in ways that manifest at regional scales. In Eastern Temperate Forests, for example, C4 grass abundances are maintained below climatic expectations where tree cover creates light limitation but above expectations where frequent fires reduce tree cover. Thus, local ecological factors, which vary among biogeographic regions, contribute to large-scale climate disequilibrium.},

	Abstract = {The role of fire in determining biome distribution in South Africa has long been debated. Acocks labelled veld types that he thought were 'fire climax' as 'false'. He hypothesised that their current extent was due to extensive forest clearance by Iron Age farmers. We tested the relative importance of fire and climate in determining ecosystem characteristics by simulating potential vegetation of South Africa with and without fire using a Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (DGVM). The simulations suggest that most of the eastern half of the country could support much higher stem biomass without fire and that the vegetation would be dominated by trees instead of grasses. Fynbos regions in mesic winter rainfall areas would also become tree dominated. We collated results of long term fire exclusion studies to further test the relative importance of fire and climate. These show that grassy ecosystems with rainfall {\textgreater}650mm tend towards fire-sensitive forests with fire excluded. Areas below 650mm showed changes in tree density and size but no trend of changing composition to forest. We discuss recent evidence that C-4 grasslands first appeared between 6 and 8M years BP, long before the appearance of modern humans. However these grassy ecosystems are among the most recently developed biomes on the planet. We briefly discuss the importance of fire in promoting their spread in the late Tertiary.},

@article{miller_spatial_2010,
	Abstract = {Animal distribution among resource patches in a habitat has for the most part been treated as a deterministic process. When patch size is large compared with the animal's foraging range, individuals assess the quality of the patch by sampling small fractions of it, the sampled area (SA). In doing so, each individual may experience different patch qualities because of stochastic distribution of animal numbers in different SAs. We constructed an analytical model to explore the effect of stochasticity in the number of individuals within an SA on animal distribution between 2 patch types. We show that under certain assumptions, a global stable equilibrium in animal distribution is achieved, but this distribution is usually not ideal because different individuals experience different patch quality even within the same patch. We calculated the animal distribution at equilibrium for 2 different well-known gain functions and recorded their deviation from their respective ideal free distributions. The dependence of those deviations on population size may exhibit complex behaviors, which include minimal and maximal points, and the occurrence of undermatching and overmatching of the superior patch. The deviations depend strongly on the used gain function and its parameters. Our study illustrates the dramatic effects of stochastic assessment of patch value on animal spatial distribution.},

After recalling that (de)stabilization can refer to various characteristics of ecosystems, like stability (in the strict sense), resilience, complexity, and risk of extinction, we show that the first question has a positive answer in the special context of slow-fast population assemblies. Then, through the comparative analysis of a few significant cases, we show that there is a convincing evidence that these measures are very strongly influenced by details of the models (or of the real ecosystem).

@article{osborne_ecological_2009,
	Abstract = {Grasses using the C-4 photosynthetic pathway dominate grasslands and savannahs of warm regions, and account for half of the species in this ecologically and economically important plant family. The C-4 pathway increases the potential for high rates of photosynthesis, particularly at high irradiance, and raises water-use efficiency compared with the C-3 type. It is therefore classically viewed as an adaptation to open, arid conditions. Here, we test this adaptive hypothesis using the comparative method, analysing habitat data for 117 genera of grasses, representing 15 C-4 lineages. The evidence from our three complementary analyses is consistent with the hypothesis that evolutionary selection for C-4 photosynthesis requires open environments, but we find an equal likelihood of C-4 evolutionary origins in mesic, arid and saline habitats. However, once the pathway has arisen, evolutionary transitions into arid habitats occur at higher rates in C-4 than C-3 clades. Extant C-4 genera therefore occupy a wider range of drier habitats than their C-3 counterparts because the C-4 pathway represents a pre-adaptation to arid conditions. Our analyses warn against evolutionary inferences based solely upon the high occurrence of extant C-4 species in dry habitats, and provide a novel interpretation of this classic ecological association.},

The long-lived evergreen trees must cope with wide temporal variation in water and nutrient availability that herbaceous species largely avoid. Evergreen trees have thus evolved mechanisms to conserve water and nutrients, and to tolerate water and nutrient stress. However, some of these adaptations have a cost. For example, evergreen trees have lower rates of photosynthesis per unit nitrogen, which can be partly explained by the use of Rubisco for nitrogen storage and the higher internal resistance to CO2 diffusion. The high internal resistance to diffusion of CO2 in evergreen trees might be an unavoidable consequence of anatomical and biochemical traits associated with leaf longevity, nutrient conservation and/or drought tolerance.},

	Abstract = {Terrestrial ecosystems sequester 2.1 Pg of atmospheric carbon annually. A large amount of the terrestrial sink is realized by forests. However, considerable uncertainties remain regarding the fate of this carbon over both short and long timescales. Relevant data to address these uncertainties are being collected at many sites around the world, but syntheses of these data are still sparse. To facilitate future synthesis activities, we have assembled a comprehensive global database for forest ecosystems, which includes carbon budget variables (fluxes and stocks), ecosystem traits (e.g. leaf area index, age), as well as ancillary site information such as management regime, climate, and soil characteristics. This publicly available database can be used to quantify global, regional or biome-specific carbon budgets; to re-examine established relationships; to test emerging hypotheses about ecosystem functioning [e.g. a constant net ecosystem production (NEP) to gross primary production (GPP) ratio]; and as benchmarks for model evaluations. In this paper, we present the first analysis of this database. We discuss the climatic influences on GPP, net primary production (NPP) and NEP and present the CO(2) balances for boreal, temperate, and tropical forest biomes based on micrometeorological, ecophysiological, and biometric flux and inventory estimates. Globally, GPP of forests benefited from higher temperatures and precipitation whereas NPP saturated above either a threshold of 1500 mm precipitation or a mean annual temperature of 10 degrees C. The global pattern in NEP was insensitive to climate and is hypothesized to be mainly determined by nonclimatic conditions such as successional stage, management, site history, and site disturbance. In all biomes, closing the CO(2) balance required the introduction of substantial biome-specific closure terms. Nonclosure was taken as an indication that respiratory processes, advection, and non-CO(2) carbon fluxes are not presently being adequately accounted for.},

	Abstract = {OCBIL theory aims to develop an integrated series of hypotheses explaining the evolution and ecology of, and best conservation practices for, biota on very old, climatically buffered, infertile landscapes (OCBILs). Conventional theory for ecology and evolutionary and conservation biology has developed primarily from data on species and communities from young, often disturbed, fertile landscapes (YODFELs), mainly in the Northern Hemisphere. OCBILs are rare, but are prominent in the Southwest Australian Floristic Region, South Africa's Greater Cape, and Venezuela's Pantepui Highlands. They may have been more common globally before Pleistocene glaciations. Based on the premise that natural selection has favoured limited dispersability of sedentary organisms, OCBILs should have elevated persistence of lineages (Gondwanan Heritage Hypothesis) and long-lived individuals (Ultimate Self Hypothesis), high numbers of localised rare endemics and strongly differentiated population systems. To counter such natural fragmentation and inbreeding due to small population size, ecological, cytogenetic and genetic mechanisms selecting for the retention of heterozygosity should feature (the James Effect). The climatic stability of OCBILs should be paralleled by persistence of adjacent semi-arid areas, conducive to speciation (Semiarid Cradle Hypothesis). Special nutritional and other biological traits associated with coping with infertile lands should be evident, accentuated in plants, for example, through water-foraging strategies, symbioses, carnivory, pollination and parasitism. The uniquely flat landscapes of southwestern Australia have had prolonged presence of saline lakes along palaeoriver systems favouring evolution of accentuated tolerance to salinity. Lastly, unusual resiliences and vulnerabilities might be evident among OCBIL organisms, such as enhanced abilities to persist in small fragmented populations but great susceptibility to major soil disturbances. In those places where it is most pertinent, OCBIL theory hopefully lays a foundation for future research and for better informed conservation management.},

When the model is forced by observed climatological sea surface temperature (SST), positive feedbacks from vegetation changes tend to increase the spatial gradient between desert regions and forest regions at the expense of savanna regions. When interannual variation of SST is included. the climate variability tends to reduce rainfall and vegetation in the wetter regions and to increase them in the drier regions along this gradient, resulting in a smoother desert-forest transition. This effect is most dramatically demonstrated in a model parameter regime for which multiple equilibria (either a desertlike or a forestlike Sahel) can exist when strong vegetation -climate feedbacks are allowed. However, the presence of a variable SST drives the desertlike state and the forestlike state toward an intermediate grasslike state, because of nonlinearities in the coupled system. Both vegetation and interannual variability thus play active roles in shaping the subtropical savanna ecosystem.},

	Abstract = {Inbreeding depression, or the decreased fitness of progeny derived from self-fertilization as compared to outcrossing, is thought to be the most general factor affecting the evolution of self-fertilization in plants. Nevertheless, data on inbreeding depression in fitness characters are almost nonexistent for perennials observed in their natural environments. In this study I measured inbreeding depression in both survival and fertility in two sympatric, short-lived, perennial herbs: hummingbird-pollinated Lobelia cardinalis (two populations) and bumblebee-pollinated L. siphilitica (one population). Crosses were performed by hand in the field, and seedlings germinated in the greenhouse. Levels of inbreeding depression were determined for one year in the greenhouse and for two to three years for seedlings transplanted back to the natural environment. Fertility was measured as flower number, which is highly correlated with seed production under natural conditions in these populations. Inbreeding depression was assessed in three ways: 1) survival and fertility within the different age intervals; 2) cumulative survival from the seed stage through each age interval; and 3) net fertility, or the expected fertility of a seed at different ages. Net fertility is a comprehensive measure of fitness combining survival and flower number. In all three populations, selfing had nonsignificant effects on the number and size of seeds. Lobelia siphilitica and one population of L. cardinalis exhibited significant levels of inbreeding depression between seed maturation and germination, excluding the consideration of possible differences in dormancy or longterm viability in the soil. There was no inbreeding depression in subsequent survival in the greenhouse in any population. In the field, significant survival differences between selfed and outcrossed progeny occurred only in two years and in only one population of L. cardinalis. For both survival and fertility there was little evidence for the expected differences among families in inbreeding depression. Compared to survival, inbreeding depression in fertility (flower number) tended to be much higher. By first-year flower production, the combined effects on survival and flower number caused inbreeding depression in net fertility to reach 54\%, 34\% and 71\% for L. siphilitica and the two populations of L. cardinalis. By the end of the second year of flowering in the field, inbreeding depression in net fertility was 53\% for L. siphilitica and 54\% for one population of L. cardinalis. For the other population of L. cardinalis, these values were 76\% through the second year of flowering and 83\% through the third year. Such high levels of inbreeding depression should strongly influence selection on those characters affecting self-fertilization rates in these two species.},

	Abstract = {Evaluating the role of terrestrial ecosystems in the global carbon cycle requires a detailed understanding of carbon exchange between vegetation, soil, and the atmosphere. Global climatic change may modify the net carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems, causing feedbacks on atmospheric CO2 and climate. We describe a model for investigating terrestrial carbon exchange and its response to climatic variation based on the processes of plant photosynthesis, carbon allocation, litter production, and soil organic carbon decomposition. The model is used to produce geographical patterns of net primary production (NPP), carbon stocks in vegetation and soils, and the seasonal variations in net ecosystem production (NEP) under both contemporary and future climates. For contemporary climate, the estimated global NPP is 57.0 Gt C y(-1), carbon stocks in vegetation and soils are 640 Gt C and 1358 Gt C, respectively, and NEP varies from -0.5 Gt C in October to 1.6 Gt C in July. For a doubled atmospheric CO2 concentration and the corresponding climate, we predict that global NPP will rise to 69.6 Gt C y(-1), carbon stocks in vegetation and soils will increase by, respectively, 133 Gt C and 160 Gt C, and the seasonal amplitude of NEP will increase by 76\%. A doubling of atmospheric CO2 without climate change may enhance NPP by 25\% and result in a substantial increase in carbon stocks in vegetation and soils. Climate change without CO2 elevation will reduce the global NPP and soil carbon stocks, but leads to an increase in vegetation carbon because of a forest extension and NPP enhancement in the north. By combining the effects of CO2 doubling, climate change, and the consequent redistribution of vegetation, we predict a strong enhancement in NPP and carbon stocks of terrestrial ecosystems. This study simulates the possible variation in the carbon exchange at equilibrium state. We anticipate to investigate the dynamic responses in the carbon exchange to atmospheric CO2 elevation and climate change in the past and future.},

	Abstract = {Climatological research in the tropics of northern Australia has focused particularly on the Australian summer monsoon. However, the timing of many ecologically important processes is determined not by the monsoon but by extra-monsoonal rainfall events. Those events produce a temporal pattern of wet and dry spells that is at least as important ecologically as the amount of rain. We defined the rainy season as that period when the probability of 10-day dry spells was less than 0.5, and the wet season as that period within the rainy season when the probability of dry spells was less than 0.1. We applied these criteria to seven stations along a strong, north-south rainfall gradient spanning more than 12degrees of latitude in tropical north Australia. The duration of the rainy and wet seasons in northern Australia decreases with increasing latitude. The timing and duration of these seasons were also affected by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The relative contribution of temporally isolated rainfall events to both the duration of the rainy season and the amount of rainfall increases with latitude. The geographic variation in these seasons corresponds to many patterns occurring in natural ecosystems. We argue that understanding the extra-monsoon rainfall events is critical to understanding how climate variation affects natural ecosystems. Copyright (C) 2001 Royal Meteorological Society.},

	Abstract = {1. Fire is important for the maintenance and conservation of African savanna ecosystems. Despite the importance of fire intensity as a key element of the fire regime, it is seldom measured or included in fire records. 2. We estimated fire intensity in the Kruger National Park, South Africa, by documenting fuel loads, fuel moisture contents, rates of fire spread and the heat yields of fuel in 956 experimental plot burns over 21 years. 3. Individual fires were conducted in five different months (February, April, August, October and December) and at five different return intervals (1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 years). Estimated fire intensities ranged from 28 to 17 905 kW m(-1). Fire season had a significant effect on fire intensity. Mean fire intensities were lowest in summer fires (1225 kW m(-1)), increased in autumn fires (1724 kW m(-1)) and highest in winter fires (2314 kW m(-1)); they were associated with a threefold difference between the mean moisture content of grass fuels in winter (28\%) and summer (88\%). 4. Mean fuel loads increased with post-fire age, from 2964 kg ha(-1) on annually burnt plots to 3972 kg ha(-1) on biennial, triennial and quadrennial burnt plots (which did not differ significantly), but decreased to 2881 kg ha(-1) on sexennial burnt plots. Fuel loads also increased with increasing rainfall over the previous 2 years. 5. Mean fire intensities showed no significant differences between annual burns and burns in the biennial, triennial and quadrennial categories, despite lower fuel loads in annual burns, suggesting that seasonal fuel moisture effects overrode those of fuel load. Mean fire intensity in sexennial burns was less than half that of other burns (638 vs. 1969 kW m(-1)). 6. We used relationships between season of fire, fuel loads and fire intensity in conjunction with the park's fire records to reconstruct broad fire intensity regimes. Changes in management from regular prescribed burning to 'natural' fires over the past four decades have resulted in a decrease in moderate-intensity fires and an increase in high-intensity fires. 7. The highest fire intensities measured in our study (11 000 - {\textgreater} 17 500 kW m(-1)) were significantly higher than those previously reported for African savannas, but were similar to those in South American cerrado vegetation. The mean fire intensity for late dry season (winter) fires in our study was less than half that reported for late dry season fires in savannas in northern Australia. 8. Synthesis and applications. Fire intensity has important effects on savanna vegetation, especially on the dynamics of the tree layer. Fire intensity varies with season (because of differences in fuel moisture) as well as with fuel load. Managers of African savannas can manipulate fire intensity by choosing the season of fire, and further by burning in years with higher or lower fuel loads. The basic relationships described here can also be used to enhance fire records, with a view to building a long-term data set for the ongoing assessment of the effectiveness of fire management.},

@article{cescatti_modelling_1997-1,
	Abstract = {A versatile model for mechanistic simulation elf the radiative transfer in discontinuous canopies is presented. Canopy structure is described with arrays of asymmetric crown envelopes, adaptable to various tree geometries and based on the following parameters: total tree height, height at crown insertion and at the greatest width of the crown, crown radii in four orthogonal directions, and shape coefficients of vertical crown profiles. Unlike previous models, this canopy model can simulate the high level of asymmetry in crown shape and displacement typical of natural and semi-natural forests. Within an individual crown, the vertical distribution of leaf area density (LAD) is modelled using the Beta or Weibull equation. The effect of the spatial pattern of leaf area is taken into account by simulating random, regular or clumped distributions. Parameters related to the canopy architecture (vertical and spatial distribution of the leaf area, angular distribution of the leaf normal) are treated as species-specific, so that mixed forests can be represented. Light penetration is modelled by the 'turbid medium hypothesis'; that is, by computing the beam path length and the LAD within single crowns with a high angular resolution (0.05-5 deg). Diffuse fluxes generated by reflection and transmission of intercepted radiation are simulated by the Adding method, on the basis of the leaf scattering coefficients of each plant species. Using this model, the distribution of radiation intensity and spectra beneath heterogeneous canopies may be analysed in time and space at the required resolution, and could complement research activities involving remote sensing, plant physiology and ecology. The software has been written in C++ with an object oriented approach, and it does not impose any limit to the number of trees or species in an experimental plot. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

@article{grant_elasticity_2000,
	Abstract = {Elasticities of lambda indicate the influence of demographic parameters on both individual fitness and population growth for a population with density-independent growth. Here we discuss the extension of elasticity analysis to populations with density-dependent demographic parameters and examine the circumstances in which the standard density-independent analysis gives useful information fur populations that are, in reality, density dependent. In the presence of density dependence the fitness of one strategy depends upon what the rest of the population is doing. Elasticities of fitness must therefore be calculated using invasibility methods, and the resulting elasticities of the invasion exponent l are not necessarily identical with elasticities of mean or equilibrium population size. The former are of interest in evolutionary studies; the latter in population management. If a population has a stable equilibrium and density dependence is a function of the total number of individuals in the population, then elasticities of fitness are equal to elasticities of lambda, and elasticities of equilibrium population size are proportional to these. Even at equilibrium, elasticities of population size are not necessarily proportional to elasticities of lambda when density dependence is a function of the number of individuals in only part of the population, as in populations regulated by competition between juveniles. Elasticities of lambda are also a relatively poor guide to elasticities of population size when population numbers fluctuate. Thus, if density dependence operates at any stage in the life history, ignoring it can result in elasticity analyses that are a misleading guide fur population management. In the presence of stochastic environmental variation, elasticities of lambda calculated for the observed mean projection matrix are often a quite accurate approximation to elasticities of fitness, even when population fluctuations: are large. An elasticity analysis on an observed mean projection matrix will often give useful information regarding selection pressures on individual demographic parameters, although this approximation usually per forms poorly for populations with nonequilibrium dynamics. Whether one is interested in life history evolution or population management, the amount of work involved in carrying out a density-dependent elasticity analysis is small, relative to the amount of work involved in quantifying demographic parameters in the field populations. It will therefore usually be worth carrying out some nonlinear analyses using plausible patterns of density dependence and environmental stochasticity to ensure that an appropriate elasticity analysis is used.},

	Abstract = {Ecologists now recognize that controversy over the relative importance of niches and neutrality cannot be resolved by analyzing species abundance patterns. Here, we use classical coexistence theory to reframe the debate in terms of stabilizing mechanisms (niches) and fitness equivalence (neutrality). The neutral model is a special case where stabilizing mechanisms are absent and species have equivalent fitness. Instead of asking whether niches or neutral processes structure communities, we advocate determining the degree to which observed diversity reflects strong stabilizing mechanisms overcoming large fitness differences or weak stabilization operating on species of similar fitness. To answer this question, we propose combining data on per capita growth rates with models to: (i) quantify the strength of stabilizing processes; (ii) quantify fitness inequality and compare it with stabilization; and (iii) manipulate frequency dependence in growth to test the consequences of stabilization and fitness equivalence for coexistence.},

@article{kokko_seasonal_1998,
	Abstract = {Birth-pulse populations are often characterized with discrete-time models, that use a single function to relate the post-breeding population size to the post-breeding size of the previous year. Recently, models of seasonal density dependence have been constructed that emphasize interactions during shorter time periods also. Here, we study two very simple forms of density-dependent mortality, that lead to Ricker and Beverton-Holt type population dynamics when viewed over the whole year. We explore the consequences of harvest timing to equilibrium population sizes under such density dependence. Whether or not individual mortality compensates for the harvested quota, the timing of harvesting has a strong impact on the sustainability of a harvesting quota. Further, we show that careless discretization of a continuous mortality scheme may seriously underestimate the reduction in population size caused by hunting and overestimate the sustainable yield. We also introduce the concept of the demographic value of an individual, which reflects the expected contribution to population size over time in the presence of density dependence. Finally, we discuss the possibility of calculating demographic values as means of optimizing harvest strategies. Here, a Pareto optimal harvest strategy will minimize the loss of demographic value from the population for a given yield. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{white_parameterization_2000,
	Abstract = {Abstract Ecosystem simulation models use descriptive input parameters to establish the physiology, biochemistry, structure, and allocation patterns of vegetation functional types, or biomes. For single-stand simulations it is possible to measure required data, but as spatial resolution increases, so too does data unavailability. Generalized biome parameterizations are then required. Undocumented parameter selection and unknown model sensitivity to parameter variation for larger-resolution simulations are currently the major limitations to global and regional modeling. The authors present documented input parameters for a process-based ecosystem simulation model, BIOME--BGC, for major natural temperate biomes. Parameter groups include the following: turnover and mortality; allocation; carbon to nitrogen ratios (C:N); the percent of plant material in labile, cellulose, and lignin pools; leaf morphology; leaf conductance rates and limitations; canopy water interception and light extinction; and the percent of leaf nitrogen in Rubisco (ribulose bisphosphate-1,5-carboxylase/oxygenase) (PLNR). Using climatic and site description data from the Vegetation/Ecosystem Modeling and Analysis Project, the sensitivity of predicted annual net primary production (NPP) to variations in parameter level of $\pm$ 20\% of the mean value was tested. For parameters exhibiting a strong control on NPP, a factorial analysis was conducted to test for interaction effects. All biomes were affected by variation in leaf and fine root C:N. Woody biomes were additionally strongly controlled by PLNR, maximum stomatal conductance, and specific leaf area while nonwoody biomes were sensitive to fire mortality and litter quality. None of the critical parameters demonstrated strong interaction effects. An alternative parameterization scheme is presented to better represent the spatial variability in several of these critical parameters. Patterns of general ecological function drawn from the sensitivity analysis are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Abstract:We developed three black bear ( Ursus americanus) habitat models in the context of a geographic information system to identify linkage areas across a major transportation corridor. One model was based on empirical habitat data, and the other two (opinion- and literature-based) were based on expert information developed in a multicriteria decision-making process. We validated the performance of the models with an independent data set. Four classes of highway linkage zones were generated. Class 3 linkages were the most accurate for mapping cross-highway movement. Our tests showed that the model based on expert literature most closely approximated the empirical model, both in the results of statistical tests and the description of the class 3 linkages. In addition, the expert literature--based model was consistently more similar to the empirical model than either of two seasonal, expert opinion--based models. Among the expert models, the literature-based model had the strongest correlation with the empirical model. Expert-opinion models were less in agreement with the empirical model. The poor performance of the expert-opinion model may be explained by an overestimation of the importance of riparian habitat by experts compared with the literature. A small portion of the empirical data to test the models was from the pre-berry season and may have affected how well the model predicted linkage areas. Our empirical and expert models represent useful tools for resource and transportation planners charged with determining the location of mitigation passages for wildlife when baseline information is lacking and when time constraints do not allow for data collection before construction.},

@article{hanan_analysis_2013,
	Abstract = {Multiple stable states, bifurcations and thresholds are fashionable concepts in the ecological literature, a recognition that complex ecosystems may at times exhibit the interesting dynamic behaviours predicted by relatively simple biomathematical models. Recently, several papers in Global Ecology and Biogeography, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, Science and elsewhere have attempted to quantify the prevalence of alternate stable states in the savannas of Africa, Australia and South America, and the tundra--taiga--grassland transitions of the circum-boreal region using satellite-derived woody canopy cover. While we agree with the logic that basins of attraction can be inferred from the relative frequencies of ecosystem states observed in space and time, we caution that the statistical methodologies underlying the satellite product used in these studies may confound our ability to infer the presence of multiple stable states. We demonstrate this point using a uniformly distributed `pseudo-tree cover' database for Africa that we use to retrace the steps involved in creation of the satellite tree-cover product and subsequent analysis. We show how classification and regression tree (CART)-based products may impose discontinuities in satellite tree-cover estimates even when such discontinuities are not present in reality. As regional and global remote sensing and geospatial data become more easily accessible for ecological studies, we recommend careful consideration of how error distributions in remote sensing products may interact with the data needs and theoretical expectations of the ecological process under study.},

	Abstract = {This study tests the ability of five Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs), forced with observed climatology and atmospheric CO2, to model the contemporary global carbon cycle. The DGVMs are also coupled to a fast `climate analogue model', based on the Hadley Centre General Circulation Model (GCM), and run into the future for four Special Report Emission Scenarios (SRES): A1FI, A2, B1, B2. Results show that all DGVMs are consistent with the contemporary global land carbon budget. Under the more extreme projections of future environmental change, the responses of the DGVMs diverge markedly. In particular, large uncertainties are associated with the response of tropical vegetation to drought and boreal ecosystems to elevated temperatures and changing soil moisture status. The DGVMs show more divergence in their response to regional changes in climate than to increases in atmospheric CO2 content. All models simulate a release of land carbon in response to climate, when physiological effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on plant production are not considered, implying a positive terrestrial climate-carbon cycle feedback. All DGVMs simulate a reduction in global net primary production (NPP) and a decrease in soil residence time in the tropics and extra-tropics in response to future climate. When both counteracting effects of climate and atmospheric CO2 on ecosystem function are considered, all the DGVMs simulate cumulative net land carbon uptake over the 21st century for the four SRES emission scenarios. However, for the most extreme A1FI emissions scenario, three out of five DGVMs simulate an annual net source of CO2 from the land to the atmosphere in the final decades of the 21st century. For this scenario, cumulative land uptake differs by 494 Pg C among DGVMs over the 21st century. This uncertainty is equivalent to over 50 years of anthropogenic emissions at current levels.},

@article{mouillot_simulating_2002,
	Abstract = {The impacts of climate change on Mediterranean-type ecosystems may result from complex interactions between direct effects on water stress and subsequent modifications in flammability and fire regime leading to changes in standing biomass and plant species composition. We analysed these interrelations through a simulation approach combining scenarios of climate change developed from GCM results and a multispecies functional model for vegetation dynamics, SIERRA. A fire risk procedure based on weekly estimates of vegetation water stress has been implemented. Using climate data from 1960 to 1997, simulations of a typical maquis woodland community have been performed as baseline and compared with two climate scenarios: a change in the rainfall regime alone, and changes in both rainfall and air temperature. Climate changes are defined by an increase in temperature, particularly in summer, and a change in the rainfall pattern leading to a decrease in low rainfall events, and an increase in intense rainfall events. The results illustrate the lack of drastic changes in the succession process, but highlight modifications in the water budget and in the length of the drought periods. Water stress lower than expected regarding statistics on the current climate is simulated, emphasizing a long-term new equilibrium of vegetation to summer drought but with a higher sensibility to rare events. Regarding fire frequency, climate changes tend to decrease the time interval between two successive fires from 20 to 16 years for the maquis shrubland and from 72 to 62 years in the forested stages. This increase in fire frequency leads to shrub-dominated landscapes, which accentuates the yield of water by additional deep drainage and runoff.},

@article{lotze-campen_scenarios_2010,
	Abstract = {Increased future demands for food, fibre and fuels from biomass can only be met if the available land and water resources on a global scale are used and managed as efficiently as possible. The main routes for making the global agricultural system more productive are through intensification and technological change on currently used agricultural land, land expansion into currently non-agricultural areas, and international trade in agricultural commodities and processed goods. In order to analyse the trade-offs and synergies between these options, we present a global bio-economic modelling approach with a special focus on spatially explicit land and water constraints as well as technological change in agricultural production. For a global bioenergy demand scenario reaching 100 ExaJoule (EJ) until 2055 we derive a required rate of productivity increase on agricultural land between 1.2 and 1.4 percent per year under different land allocation options. A very high pressure for yield increase occurs in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, even without additional bioenergy demand. Moreover, we analyse the implicit values (shadow prices) of limited water resources. The shadow prices for bioenergy are provided as a metric for assessing the trade-offs between different land allocation options and as a link between the agricultural and energy sector.

@article{cobb_mortality_2013,
	Abstract = {* Few studies have quantified pathogen impacts to ecosystem processes, despite the fact that pathogens cause or contribute to regional-scale tree mortality.


* We measured litterfall mass, litterfall chemistry, and soil nitrogen (N) cycling associated with multiple hosts along a gradient of mortality caused by Phytophthora ramorum, the cause of sudden oak death.


* In redwood forests, the epidemiological and ecological characteristics of the major overstory species determine disease patterns and the magnitude and nature of ecosystem change. Bay laurel (Umbellularia californica) has high litterfall N (0.992\%), greater soil extractable NO3--N, and transmits infection without suffering mortality. Tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus) has moderate litterfall N (0.723\%) and transmits infection while suffering extensive mortality that leads to higher extractable soil NO3--N. Redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) has relatively low litterfall N (0.519\%), does not suffer mortality or transmit the pathogen, but dominates forest biomass.


* The strongest impact of pathogen-caused mortality was the potential shift in species composition, which will alter litterfall chemistry, patterns and dynamics of litterfall mass, and increase soil NO3--N availability. Patterns of P. ramorum spread and consequent mortality are closely associated with bay laurel abundances, suggesting this species will drive both disease emergence and subsequent ecosystem function.},

	Abstract = {Biodiversity plays a vital role for ecosystem functioning in a
 changing environment. Yet theoretical approaches that incorporate
 diversity into classical ecosystem theory do not provide a general
 dynamic theory based on mechanistic principles. In this paper, we
 suggest that approaches developed for quantitative genetics can be
 extended to ecosystem functioning by modeling the means and variances
 of phenotypes within a group of species. We present a framework that
 suggests that phenotypic variance within functional groups is linearly
 related to their ability to respond to environmental changes. As a
 result, the long-term productivity for a group of species with high
 phenotypic variance may be higher than for the best single species,
 even though high phenotypic variance decreases productivity in the
 short term, because suboptimal species are present. In addition, we
 find that in the case of accelerating environmental change, species
 succession in a changing environment may become discontinuous. Our work
 suggests that this phenomenon is related to diversity as well as to the
 environmental disturbance regime, both of which are affected by
 anthropogenic activities. By introducing new techniques for modeling
 the aggregate behavior of groups of species, the present approach may
 provide a new avenue for ecosystem analysis.},

	Abstract = {Australian savannas exhibit marked seasonality in precipitation, with more than 90\% of the annual total falling between October and May. The dry season is characterized by declining soil water availability and high vapor pressure deficits (up to 2.5 kPa). We used heat pulse technology to measure whole-tree transpiration rates on a daily and seasonal basis for the two dominant eucalypts at a site near Darwin, Australia. Contrary to expectations, transpiration rates were higher during the dry season than during the wet season, largely because of increased evaporative demand and the exploitation of groundwater reserves by the trees. Transpiration rates exhibited a marked hysteresis in relation to vapor pressure deficit, which was more marked in the dry season than in the wet season. This result may be attributable to low soil hydraulic conductivity, or the use of stored stem water, or both. Tree water use was strongly correlated with leaf area and diameter at breast height and there were no differences in transpiration between the species studied. These results are discussed in relation to scaling tree water use to stand water use.},

These specializations are ubiquitous in plant communities, but all three have never been derived from a spatial model of community dynamics-instead, the possibility of rapid exploitation has been either overlooked or confounded with colonization. We use moment equations, equations for the mean densities and spatial covariance of competing plant populations, to characterize these strategies in a fully spatial stochastic model. The moment equations predict endogenous spatial pattern formation and the efficacy of spatial strategies under different conditions. The model shows that specializations for colonization, exploitation, and tolerance are all possible, and these are the only possible spatial strategies; among them, they partition all of the endogenous spatial structure in the environment. The model predicts two distinct short-dispersal specializations where parents disperse their offspring locally, either to exploit empty patches quickly or to fill patches to exclude competitors.},

	Abstract = {Positive aboveground biomass trends have been reported from old-growth forests across the Amazon basin and hypothesized to reflect a large-scale response to exterior forcing. The result could, however, be an artefact due to a sampling bias induced by the nature of forest growth dynamics. Here, we characterize statistically the disturbance process in Amazon old-growth forests as recorded in 135 forest plots of the RAINFOR network up to 2006, and other independent research programmes, and explore the consequences of sampling artefacts using a data-based stochastic simulator. Over the observed range of annual aboveground biomass losses, standard statistical tests show that the distribution of biomass losses through mortality follow an exponential or near-identical Weibull probability distribution and not a power law as assumed by others. The simulator was parameterized using both an exponential disturbance probability distribution as well as a mixed exponential--power law distribution to account for potential large-scale blowdown events. In both cases, sampling biases turn out to be too small to explain the gains detected by the extended RAINFOR plot network. This result lends further support to the notion that currently observed biomass gains for intact forests across the Amazon are actually occurring over large scales at the current time, presumably as a response to climate change.},

The proposed solutions for humans rely on highly advanced skills such as negotiation, which raises the question of how non-human organisms manage to resolve similar tragedies. In recent years, this question has promoted evolutionary biologists to apply the tragedy of the commons to a wide range of biological systems. Here, we provide tools to categorize different types of tragedy and review different mechanisms, including kinship, policing and diminishing returns that can resolve conflicts that could otherwise end in tragedy. A central open question, however, is how often biological systems are able to resolve these scenarios rather than drive themselves extinct through individual-level selection favouring self-interested behaviours.},

@article{huisman_species_1999,
	Abstract = {With the eutrophication of many freshwaters and coastal environments, phytoplankton blooms have become a common phenomenon. This article uses a reaction-diffusion model to investigate the implications of mixing processes for the dynamics and species composition of phytoplankton blooms. The model identifies four key parameters for bloom development: incident light intensity, background turbidity, water column depth, and turbulent mixing rates. The model predicts that the turbulent mixing rate is a major determinant of the species composition of phytoplankton blooms. In well-mixed environments, the species with lowest "critical light intensity" should become dominant. But at low mixing rates, the species with lowest critical light intensity is displaced if other species obtain a better position in the light gradient. Instead of a gradual change in species composition, the model predicts steep transitions between the dominance regions of the various species. The model predicts a low species diversity: phytoplankton blooms in eutrophic environments should be dominated by one or a few species only. The model predictions are consistent with laboratory competition experiments and many existing field data. We recommend examining competition in phytoplankton blooms under well-controlled laboratory conditions, and we derive scaling rules that facilitate translation from the laboratory to the field.},

	Abstract = {The introduction of the American eastern grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) in Europe is causing a dramatic decline of the native European red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris), due to competition. We used spatially explicit population dynamics models to illustrate the potential expansion of the grey squirrel from Italy, the only continental country with the species, into neighbouring countries. Simulations started with the known grey squirrel distributions in 1996 and modelled the spread for the next 100 years in two different scenarios. One "best case" in which a random seed crop pattern of poor, good and mast seed crops was simulated with concomitant effects on squirrel fecundity and mortality and one "worst case" scenario in which poor years were not included. In the best case scenario, it will take 30-40 years for grey squirrels to start invading the Alps and about 70-75 years to cross the border between Italy and France. First populations in Switzerland are predicted in 2051-2066. In the worst case scenario, the spread will be significantly faster: the species is predicted to reach France in 2026-2031 and Switzerland in 2031-2041. Removing two of the three populations of grey squirrel will likely postpone the invasion of Switzerland but not of France. Large areas of Europe contain potentially good habitat for grey squirrels, and expansion from Italy, to France, Switzerland and belong to most of Eurasia is simply a matter of time. This will represent a serious risk for the conservation of the native red squirrel and will have implications for national forest operations. However, a European policy towards introduced species is still lacking. There is therefore a need for a co-ordinated European approach to the management of the grey squirrel and other introduced species.},

@article{lamanna_functional_2014,
	Abstract = {The processes causing the latitudinal gradient in species richness remain elusive. Ecological theories for the origin of biodiversity gradients, such as competitive exclusion, neutral dynamics, and environmental filtering, make predictions for how functional diversity should vary at the alpha (within local assemblages), beta (among assemblages), and gamma (regional pool) scales. We test these predictions by quantifying hypervolumes constructed from functional traits representing major axes of plant strategy variation (specific leaf area, plant height, and seed mass) in tree assemblages spanning the temperate and tropical New World. Alpha-scale trait volume decreases with absolute latitude and is often lower than sampling expectation, consistent with environmental filtering theory. Beta-scale overlap decays with geographic distance fastest in the temperate zone, again consistent with environmental filtering theory. In contrast, gamma-scale trait space shows a hump-shaped relationship with absolute latitude, consistent with no theory. Furthermore, the overall temperate trait hypervolume was larger than the overall tropical hypervolume, indicating that the temperate zone permits a wider range of trait combinations or that niche packing is stronger in the tropical zone. Although there are limitations in the data, our analyses suggest that multiple processes have shaped trait diversity in trees, reflecting no consistent support for any one theory.},

However, very few models are able to predict species distribution accurately, although we know species respond individually to climate change. Here we show, using a process-based model (PHENOFIT), that tree species distributions can be predicted precisely if the biological processes of survival and reproductive success only are incorporated as a function of phenology. These predictions showed great predictive power when tested against present distributions of two North American speciesquaking aspen and sugar mapleindicating that on a broad scale, the fundamental niche of trees coincides with their realized niche. Phenology is shown here to be a major determinant of plant species range and should therefore be used to assess the consequences of global warming on plant distributions, and the spread of alien plant species.},

	Abstract = {Soil respiration, R-S, the flux of microbially and plant-respired carbon dioxide (CO2) from the soil surface to the atmosphere, is the second-largest terrestrial carbon flux(1-3). However, the dynamics of R-S are not well understood and the global flux remains poorly constrained(4,5). Ecosystem warming experiments(6,7), modelling analyses(8,9) and fundamental biokinetics(10) all suggest that R-S should change with climate. This has been difficult to confirm observationally because of the high spatial variability of R-S, inaccessibility of the soil medium and the inability of remote-sensing instruments to measure R-S on large scales. Despite these constraints, it may be possible to discern climate-driven changes in regional or global R-S values in the extant four-decade record of R-S chamber measurements. Here we construct a database of worldwide R-S observations matched with high-resolution historical climate data and find a previously unknown temporal trend in the R-S record after accounting for mean annual climate, leaf area, nitrogen deposition and changes in CO2 measurement technique. We find that the air temperature anomaly (the deviation from the 1961-1990 mean) is significantly and positively correlated with changes in R-S. We estimate that the global R-S in 2008 (that is, the flux integrated over the Earth's land surface over 2008) was 98 +/- 12 Pg C and that it increased by 0.1 Pg C yr(-1) between 1989 and 2008, implying a global R-S response to air temperature (Q(10)) of 1.5. An increasing global R-S value does not necessarily constitute a positive feedback to the atmosphere, as it could be driven by higher carbon inputs to soil rather than by mobilization of stored older carbon. The available data are, however, consistent with an acceleration of the terrestrial carbon cycle in response to global climate change.},

	Abstract = {Aim To provide the first global quantification of the slope and shape of the latitudinal gradient in seed mass, and to determine whether global patterns in seed mass are best explained by growth form, vegetation type, seed dispersal syndrome, or net primary productivity (NPP). Location Global. Methods We collected seed mass data for 11,481 species x site combinations from around the world. We used regression to describe the latitudinal gradient in seed mass, then applied general linear models to quantify the relative explanatory power of each of the variables hypothesized to underlie the latitudinal gradient in seed size. Results There is a 320-fold decline in geometric mean seed mass between the equator and 60 degrees. This decline is not linear. At the edge of the tropics, there is a sudden 7-fold drop in mean seed mass. The strongest correlates of the latitudinal gradient in seed mass are plant growth form, and vegetation type, followed by dispersal syndrome and NPP. A model including growth form, vegetation type, dispersal syndrome and NPP explains 51\% of the variation in seed mass. Latitude explains just 0.2\% of the residual variation from this model. Main Conclusions This is the first demonstration of a major decrease in seed size at the edge of the tropics. This drop in seed mass is most closely correlated with changes in plant growth form and vegetation type. This suggests that the drop in seed mass might be part of a sudden change in plant strategy at the edge of the tropics.},

@article{holmgren_ideal_1995,
	Abstract = {1. The spatial distribution of foraging predators differing in foraging traits was investigated theoretically. Three types of individual differences were investigated: dominance that determines the outcomes in fights for food, searching efficiency and prey handling efficiency. The basic assumptions were: (i) predators search for prey; (ii) encountered prey takes time to handle; (iii) the handling process may be interrupted by a searching competitor initiating a conflict about the prey; (iv) conflicts take an expected time to settle; and (v) the winner resumes handling and the loser resumes searching. 2. Stable equilibrium distributions were found in all cases, in the sense that no competitor could achieve a higher intake rate from switching patch. 3. When it was assumed that each of the predators was different from the others, the ideal free distributions of the dominance model and the handling efficiency model resembled one another. A boundary phenotype existed with more dominant/efficient competitors only occurring in the high prey density patch and less dominant/efficient ones occurring mixed across patches. This was labelled semitruncated distribution. In the search efficiency model, the distribution was truncated, i.e. competitors less efficient than the boundary phenotype only occurred in the high prey density patch whereas the more efficient competitors occurred in the low prey density patch. 4. The models were also analysed with the predators classified into two types. As the density of competitors increased, the solution approached a set of neutral equilibria where a few predators of the more efficient type could be exchanged for a larger number of the less efficient type to reach a new equilibrium. 5. The density of predators may be negatively correlated with patch productivity and prey density when predators differ in handling efficiency. Prey-searching efficiency of predators was negatively correlated with predator density, patch productivity and prey density. Its consequences for the conservation of species are discussed.},

We analyzed the structural response of woody plants to long-term experimental burning in savannas. The experiment uses a randomized block design to examine fire exclusion and the season and frequency of burn in 192 7-ha experimental plots located in four different savanna ecosystems. Although previous studies would lead us to expect tree density to respond to the fire regime, our results, obtained from four different savanna ecosystems, suggest that the density of woody individuals was unresponsive to fire. The relative dominance of small trees was, however, highly responsive to fire regime. The observed shift in the structure of tree populations has potentially large impacts on the carbon balance. However, the response of tree biomass to fire of the different savannas studied were different, making it difficult to generalize about the extent to which fire can be used to manipulate carbon sequestration in savannas. This study provides evidence that savannas are demographically resilient to fire, but structurally responsive.},

@article{mouillot_fire_2005,
	Abstract = {A yearly global fire history is a prerequisite for quantifying the contribution of previous fires to the past and present global carbon budget. Vegetation fires can have both direct (combustion) and long-term indirect effects on the carbon cycle. Every fire influences the ecosystem carbon budget for many years, as a consequence of internal reorganization, decomposition of dead biomass, and regrowth. We used a two-step process to estimate these effects. First we synthesized the available data available for the 1980s or 1990s to produce a global fire map. For regions with no data, we developed estimates based on vegetation type and history. Second, we then worked backwards to reconstruct the fire history. This reconstruction was based on published data when available. Where it was not, we extrapolated from land use practices, qualitative reports and local studies, such as tree ring analysis. The resulting product is intended as a first approximation for questions about consequences of historical changes in fire for the global carbon budget. We estimate that an average of 608 Mha yr(-1) burned (not including agricultural fires) at the end of the 20th century. 86\% of this occurred in tropical savannas. Fires in forests with higher carbon stocks consumed 70.7 Mha yr(-1) at the beginning of the century, mostly in the boreal and temperate forests of the Northern Hemisphere. This decreased to 15.2 Mha yr(-1) in the 1960s as a consequence of fire suppression policies and the development of efficient fire fighting equipment. Since then, fires in temperate and boreal forests have decreased to 11.2 Mha yr(-1). At the same time, burned areas increased exponentially in tropical forests, reaching 54 Mha yr(-1) in the 1990s, reflecting the use of fire in deforestation for expansion of agriculture. There is some evidence for an increase in area burned in temperate and boreal forests in the closing years of the 20th century.},

	Abstract = {Patch dieback occurred in an almost monospecific Colophospermum mopane (Kirk ex Benth.) Kirk ex J. Leonard woodland in the Northern Province, South Africa, following severe droughts in 1988-1989 and 1991-1992. Discrete patches of dieback and adjacent paired areas of 'healthy' vegetation lost an average of 87 and 13\% of basal area to mortality, respectively. Whole trees mostly died on 'dead' plots, while single-stem mortality prevailed on 'live' plots. Tree mortality decreased with increasing stem number per tree. Patch dieback did not occur on sandy soils. On fine-textured soils, variation in soil type, topography or slope did not affect dieback. Dieback was influenced by vegetation structure, soil surface condition and soil chemistry. Intense intertree competition, shown by self-thinning occurring prior to dieback, was a precondition for dieback. Intertree competition had heightened during the 30 years prior to dieback because of an increase in woody cover. Dieback patches had changed from functioning as sinks of water and sediment to sources of these as a result of loss of perennial herbaceous cover, decreased water retention on bared surfaces, and accelerated erosion during 50 years of livestock ranching. Vegetation had thus become increasingly drought-prone, exacerbated in places by soils with a high sodium concentration. Dieback had occurred because the water requirements of C. mopane could no longer be met during drought years on the dysfunctional patches.},

	Abstract = {The response of terrestrial vegetation to a globally changing environment is central to predictions of future levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide(1,2). The role of tropical forests is critical because they are carbon- dense and highly productive(3,4). Inventory plots across Amazonia show that old- growth forests have increased in carbon storage over recent decades(5-7), but the response of one- third of the world's tropical forests in Africa(8) is largely unknown owing to an absence of spatially extensive observation networks(9,10). Here we report data from a ten- country network of long- term monitoring plots in African tropical forests. We find that across 79 plots ( 163 ha) above- ground carbon storage in live trees increased by 0.63 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) between 1968 and 2007 ( 95\% confidence interval ( CI), 0.22 - 0.94; mean interval, 1987 - 96). Extrapolation to unmeasured forest components ( live roots, small trees, necromass) and scaling to the continent implies a total increase in carbon storage in African tropical forest trees of 0.34 Pg C yr(-1) ( CI, 0.15 - 0.43). These reported changes in carbon storage are similar to those reported for Amazonian forests per unit area(6,7), providing evidence that increasing carbon storage in old- growth forests is a pan- tropical phenomenon. Indeed, combining all standardized inventory data from this study and from tropical America and Asia(5,6,11) together yields a comparable figure of 0.49 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) (n = 156; 562 ha; CI, 0.29 - 0.66; mean interval, 1987 - 97). This indicates a carbon sink of 1.3 Pg C yr(-1) ( CI, 0.8 - 1.6) across all tropical forests during recent decades. Taxon- specific analyses of African inventory and other data(12) suggest that widespread changes in resource availability, such as increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, may be the cause of the increase in carbon stocks(13), as some theory(14) and models(2,10,15) predict.},

	Abstract = {The projected climate-change signal in simulations by the Con formal-Cubic Atmospheric Model (CCAM) over southern Africa is presented, with particular emphasis on the projected changes in circulation over the region. Current (1975-2005) and future (2070-2100; A2 scenario) climate simulations are used for this purpose. In the austral winter of the future climate, frontal rain bands are displaced to the south as a result of the subtropical high-pressure belt intensifying to the south of the subcontinent. In spring and autumn, mid- and upper-level highs are simulated to become more prominent over the eastern and central parts of southern Africa. The enhanced subsidence associated with these systems results in generally lower rainfall totals over much of the south-eastern subcontinent. To the north of these highs, enhanced westward moisture advection contributes to increased rainfall totals over northern Mozambique, whilst along the western periphery of the anomalously strong highs, enhanced southward moisture advection results in higher rainfall totals over Namibia, Botswana and the central and western interior of South Africa. In mid-summer, the Indian Ocean High (IOH) is simulated to intensify most over the south-western Indian Ocean (IO). This seemingly results in the more frequent occurrence of the cloud bands that constitute the South Indian Convergence Zone (SICZ) over the Southeastern subcontinent - resulting in generally wetter conditions over this region.

	Abstract = {Riparian wetlands are under heavy pressure from hydrological changes produced by dam construction and water diversion projects. There has been ample documentation of the relationship between the extent of flooding and the composition of shoreline plant communities, yet we have few models that allow us to predict the impact of altered flooding regimes on riparian wetlands. In the humid temperate zone, river regulation commonly affects the distribution of two major vegetation types: wooded wetland and herbaceous wetland. The practice of reducing peak floods and augmenting minimum river flows is often followed by the succession of herbaceous to wooded wetland. We used logistic regression models to describe the distribution of wooded wetland as a function of all possible combinations of seven hydrological variables. The variables were chosen to reflect the depth, duration, and time of flooding and were calculated for four different time intervals (3, 7, 12, and 18 growing seasons). Our best model was a combination of two variables: the last day of the first flood and the time of the second flood. For three of the four time intervals, the vegetation type was correctly identified as herbaceous or wooded for {\textgreater} 80\% of the sample points. Our results suggest that models based on a few key environmental variables can be valuable tools in the conservation management of the vegetation of temperate and boreal zone wetlands.},

@article{laurans_functional_2012,
	Abstract = {* Niche differentiation is a key issue in the current debate on community assembly mechanisms. In highly diverse moist tropical forests, tree species sensitivity to canopy openness is thought to be a major axis in niche differentiation. In the past, the syndrome of traits driving the demographic trade-off involved in the niche-based theory of coexistence has always been established among species situated at the two extremities of the shade-tolerance gradient, even though most tropical tree species have intermediate light requirements. In addition, trait plasticity has seldom been linked to tropical tree species distribution along environmental gradients. * This article examines covariations between leaf traits, whole-plant traits and niche parameters among 14 tree species with intermediate light requirements in French Guiana and across a range of canopy openness. Each functional trait measured under field conditions was characterized by a median value and a degree of plasticity expressed under contrasting light regimes. Niche differentiation was characterized in terms of spatial light gradient. We first examined covariations between functional traits then explored to what degree the median value and plasticity in functional traits could predict light niche characteristics at the sapling stage and the ontogenetic change in light availability estimated by adult stature. * Leaf mass per area (LMA) was positively correlated with leaf life span (LLS); species with higher LMA and higher LLS displayed lower diameter growth rates (GRs) and lower responsiveness to canopy gap at both whole-plant and population levels. This proved that the relationships previously established over a broader range of species held true within the narrow range of the light requirements covered. * Height GR plasticity accounted for 49\% of the variation in light niche optimum. LMA plasticity, unlike LLS plasticity, was significantly correlated with light niche breadth and adult stature. * Synthesis. This study demonstrates the relevance of considering the phenotypic plasticity in functional traits in community ecology, particularly for quantifying breadth of species distribution over environmental gradients. Our findings did not support Hubbell's hypothesis of functional equivalence and suggest that even a rather subtle variation in forest canopy disturbance promotes the coexistence of tropical tree species.},

The study, which lasted 3 years, shows that the onset and duration of growth and flowering are correlated with the timing and abundance of precipitation. Whereas variation in total rain does not affect the onset of flowering in phanerophytes and chameaphytes, therophytes and geophytes are affected. Late rain delays the onset of all phenological phases in all life-forms. Peak growth occurs fi om December to January and flowering from February to April depending on rain. Phanerophytes are least affected in their growth phenophase with less rain. Flowering in phanerophytes and chamaephytes occurs from 4 to 6 weeks after rain and in therophytes from 2 to 8 weeks after rain. The sequence of flowering for the majority of species is more or less constant despite differences in the timing and amount of rain. An assessment of climatic variability for the area suggests that at least 10 years of study would be required to encompass the full range of plant phenological patterns in a gravel desert wadi in Oman.

	Abstract = {1. Competition theory predicts that community structure may be shaped by resource partitioning between co-occurring species. As such, quantifying the degree of resource partitioning (i.e., niche overlap) is a key component of studies examining community structure and species coexistence. 2. For many organisms, multiple resource axes quantify niche space. Each axis may be described by a different type of data (e.g. categorical, continuous, count or binary data, as well as electivity scores), with different data types requiring different statistical treatments. Therefore, incorporating multiple axes into a single measure of niche space is problematic. 3. Here, we propose general methods for combining multiple niche axes, each characterized by different data types, within a unified analysis of niche overlap. Using appropriate transformations and probability models, we show that each data type can give rise to directly comparable measures of niche overlap, with the overlap statistic between two species defined as the overlapping area between the distributions for each species. 4. Measurements derived from different types of data can be combined into a single unified analysis of niche overlap by averaging over multiple axes. 5. We then describe null model permutation tests that assess statistical differences in niche overlap, which can address questions commonly posed by population ecologists (e.g. do two species occupy different niche space?) and community ecologists (e.g. are multiple species evenly distributed across niche space?). 6. To illustrate the use of these newly devised indices, we use an example from reef fishes that combines ratio, categorical and electivity data, and an example from alpine plants that combines continuous and ratio data. 7. The methods described in this article are relevant to a wide variety of ecological projects, including the investigation of invasive species, relative abundance distributions, global change, species coexistence and evolutionary diversification.},

	Abstract = {We present a new soil respiration model, describe a formal model testing procedure, and compare our model with five alternative models using an extensive data set of observed soil respiration. Gas flux data from rangeland soils that included a large number of measurements at low temperatures were used to model soil CO2 emissions as a function of soil temperature and water content. Our arctangent temperature function predicts that Q(10) values vary inversely with temperature and that CO2 fluxes are significant below 0 degrees C. Independent data representing a broad range of ecosystems and temperature values were used for model testing. The effects of plant phenology, differences in substrate availability among sites, and water limitation were accounted for so that the temperature equations could be fairly evaluated. Four of the six tested models did equally well at simulating the observed soil CO2 respiration rates. However, the arctangent variable Q(10) model agreed closely with observed Q(10) values over a wide range of temperatures (r(2)=0.94) and was superior to published variable Q(10) equations using the Akaike information criterion (AIC). The arctangent temperature equation explained 16-85\% of the observed intra-site variability in CO2 flux rates. Including a water stress factor yielded a stronger correlation than temperature alone only in the dryland soils. The observed change in Q(10) with increasing temperature was the same for data sets that included only heterotrophic respiration and data sets that included both heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration.},

@article{cramer_global_2001-1,
	Abstract = {The possible responses of ecosystem processes to rising atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate change are illustrated using six dynamic global vegetation models that explicitly represent the interactions of ecosystem carbon and water exchanges with vegetation dynamics. The models are driven by the IPCC IS92a scenario of rising CO2 (Wigley et al. 1991), and by climate changes resulting from effective CO2 concentrations corresponding to IS92a, simulated by the coupled ocean atmosphere model HadCM2-SUL. Simulations with changing CO2 alone show a widely distributed terrestrial carbon sink of 1.4--3.8 Pg C y−1 during the 1990s, rising to 3.7--8.6 Pg C y−1 a century later. Simulations including climate change show a reduced sink both today (0.6--3.0 Pg C y−1) and a century later (0.3--6.6 Pg C y−1) as a result of the impacts of climate change on NEP of tropical and southern hemisphere ecosystems. In all models, the rate of increase of NEP begins to level off around 2030 as a consequence of the `diminishing return' of physiological CO2 effects at high CO2 concentrations. Four out of the six models show a further, climate-induced decline in NEP resulting from increased heterotrophic respiration and declining tropical NPP after 2050. Changes in vegetation structure influence the magnitude and spatial pattern of the carbon sink and, in combination with changing climate, also freshwater availability (runoff). It is shown that these changes, once set in motion, would continue to evolve for at least a century even if atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate could be instantaneously stabilized. The results should be considered illustrative in the sense that the choice of CO2 concentration scenario was arbitrary and only one climate model scenario was used. However, the results serve to indicate a range of possible biospheric responses to CO2 and climate change. They reveal major uncertainties about the response of NEP to climate change resulting, primarily, from differences in the way that modelled global NPP responds to a changing climate. The simulations illustrate, however, that the magnitude of possible biospheric influences on the carbon balance requires that this factor is taken into account for future scenarios of atmospheric CO2 and climate change.},

@article{huisman_light-limited_1994,
	Abstract = {Light is never distributed homogeneously since it forms a gradient over biomass. As a consequence, the common theories on nutrient competition are not applicable to competition for light. In this paper, we investigate a model for light-limited growth and competition among phytoplankton species in a mixed water column. The model is based on standard assumptions such as Lambert-Beer's law of light absorption, a Monod equation for carbon uptake, and constant specific carbon losses. By introducing the concept of quantum return, we show that the dynamics of growth and competition can be quantified not only in terms of depth but also directly in terms of light availability. We argue that the crucial measure for phytoplankton growth is not a ''critical depth'' but a ''critical light intensity,'' I-out*. For each species, I-out* corresponds to the equilibrium light intensity at the bottom of a water column when the species is grown in monoculture. I-out* plays a role similar to the ''critical nutrient concentration'' R* used in models of nutrient-limited growth. For a constant light supply, the species with the lowest I-out* will competitively exclude all other species. There are, however, some important differences between R* and I-out*. Whereas R* reflects both the local and the total balance between nutrient uptake and nutrient losses, I-out* only reflects the total carbon balance. Moreover, I-out* decreases with increasing light supply, whereas R* is independent of the nutrient supply. As a consequence, (1) the outcome of competition for light may depend on the light supply, (2) the compensation point is not a good predictor for the outcome of competition, (3) the resource ratio hypothesis does not apply when species compete for both nutrients and light. The outcome of competition for nutrients and light may depend on the nutrient and light supply, on the mixing depth, and on the background turbidity due to inanimate substances.},

The objective of this field study was to determine seasonal tiller demographics and leaf area index (LAI) of intermediate wheatgrass [Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkw. \& D.R. Dewey], smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), and big bluest em (Andropogon gerardii Vitman) tiller populations. This study was conducted in 1992 and 1993 near Mead, NE, on a silty clay loam soil (Typic Argiudoll) as a randomized complete block. Monocultures were harvested six times each year for tiller demographics. Additionally, mean stage count (MSG), a quantified estimate of tiller population maturity, was determined at each harvest. The LAI was indirectly measured using a canopy analyzer at 7- to 14-d intervals. Tiller density for all species generally declined as MSC increased. Tiller demographics were highly variable by year for intermediate wheatgrass and smooth bromegrass, which indicates that grazing management should be based on current tiller populations. Density of vegetative tillers declined most rapidly for smooth bromegrass, followed by intermediate wheatgrass, switchgrass, and big bluestem. Switchgrass and big bluestem tiller demographics were more uniform and predictable across years than intermediate wheatgrass and smooth bromegrass. The LAI for all species increased as MSC increased. Maximum LAI for intermediate wheatgrass, smooth bromegrass, switchgrass, and big bluestem in 1992 was 4.7, 5.1, 4.9, and 5.8, respectively. Integrating tiller demographics and LAI suggests that initial grazing readiness starts with smooth bromegrass in early spring, followed by intermediate wheatgrass in about 2 wk, switchgrass in late spring, and big bluestem in early summer.},

	Abstract = {Potential relative increment (PRI) is a new method to derive optimal diameter growth equations using inventory information from a large public database. Optimal growth equations for 24 species were developed using plot and tree records from several states (Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin) of the north central US. Most species were represented by thousands of individuals measured across an extensive geographic region that presumably covered a large range of possible environmental conditions. Thus, it was assumed that the individuals growing at the highest rate for each diameter class represented a reasonable estimate of size-specific optimal growth. Comparison of PRI equations among several hardwood and conifer species of differing shade tolerance indicated that unique patterns of optimal diameter growth result. The PRI methodology is similar to other optimal growth models in both shape and trends of predicted growth, but is easier to calculate and offers more flexibility than many other designs.

	Abstract = {The stabilization of atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations is the ultimate objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. To investigate the gas emissions required to achieve this goal for CO2 over the next few hundred years, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)(1,2) has used two sets of concentration pathways ('profiles'). One set is based solely on smooth changes in emission towards concentration stabilization(3), and the other goes further by incorporating economic considerations(4). Here I devise new profiles that take into account emissions-limitation proposals restricted to 'Annex I' (developed) countries, as well as the constraints imposed by more recent emissions data (now available until the end of 1995; ref. 5). The Annex I scenarios considered are two that span proposals recently considered by the IPCC6, and a less restrictive case. Using the new CO2-concentration profiles and a carbon-cycle model(7) to determine global CO2 emissions, and taking into account the prescribed Annex I country emissions, I determine the CO2-emission requirements for non-Annex I (developing) countries to achieve the stabilization of atmospheric concentration at about twice preindustrial values, I show that action by Annex I countries within the bounds of the scenarios considered can mean that non-Annex I countries have several decades before their emissions need to depart significantly from a 'business as usual' (no intervention) trajectory. Alternatively, if international trade in carbon emissions is permitted, non-Annex I countries can choose to emit below their 'business as usual' baseline and benefit from the trading of emission rights.},

	Abstract = {Both resource and disturbance controls have been invoked to explain tree persistence among grasses in savannas. Here we determine the extent to which competition for available resources restricts the rooting depth of both grasses and trees, and how this may influence nutrient cycling under an infrequently burned savanna near Darwin, Australia. We sampled fine roots {\textless}2 mm in diameter from 24 soil pits under perennial as well as annual grasses and three levels of canopy cover. The relative proportion of C3 (trees) and C4 (grasses) derived carbon in a sample was determined using mass balance calculations. Our results show that regardless of the type of grass both tree and grass roots are concentrated in the top 20 cm of the soil. While trees have greater root production and contribute more fine root biomass grass roots contribute a disproportional amount of nitrogen and carbon to the soil relative to total root biomass. We postulate that grasses maintain soil nutrient pools and provide biomass for regular fires that prevent forest trees from establishing while savanna trees, are important for increasing soil N content, cycling and mineralization rates. We put forward our ideas as a hypothesis of resource-regulated tree--grass coexistence in tropical savannas.},

	Abstract = {Data from spaceborne light detection and ranging (lidar) opens the possibility to map forest vertical structure globally. We present a wall-to-wall, global map of canopy height at 1-km spatial resolution, using 2005 data from the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) aboard ICESat (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite). A challenge in the use of GLAS data for global vegetation studies is the sparse coverage of lidar shots (mean = 121 data points/degree2 for the L3C campaign). However, GLAS-derived canopy height (RH100) values were highly correlated with other, more spatially dense, ancillary variables available globally, which allowed us to model global RH100 from forest type, tree cover, elevation, and climatology maps. The difference between the model predicted RH100 and footprint level lidar-derived RH100 values showed that error increased in closed broadleaved forests such as the Amazon, underscoring the challenges in mapping tall ({\textgreater}40 m) canopies. The resulting map was validated with field measurements from 66 FLUXNET sites. The modeled RH100 versus in situ canopy height error (RMSE = 6.1 m, R2 = 0.5; or, RMSE = 4.4 m, R2 = 0.7 without 7 outliers) is conservative as it also includes measurement uncertainty and sub pixel variability within the 1-km pixels. Our results were compared against a recently published canopy height map. We found our values to be in general taller and more strongly correlated with FLUXNET data. Our map reveals a global latitudinal gradient in canopy height, increasing towards the equator, as well as coarse forest disturbance patterns.},

	Abstract = {The role of acclimation of dark respiration to temperature and CO2 concentration and its relationship to growth are critical in determining plant response to predicted global change. We explored temperature acclimation of respiration in seedlings of tree species of the North American boreal forest. Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera, Larix laricina, Pinus banksiana, and Picea mariana plants were grown from seed in controlled-environments at current and elevated concentrations of CO2 (370 and 580 mu mol mol(-1)) in combination with three temperature treatments of 18/12, 24/18, and 30/24 degrees C (light/dark period). Specific respiration rates of roots and shoots acclimated to temperature, damping increases in rates across growth-temperature environments compared to short-term temperature responses. Compared at a standard temperature, root and shoot respiration rates were, on average, 40\% lower in plants grown at the highest compared to lowest growth temperature. Broad-leaved species had a lower degree of temperature acclimation of respiration than did the conifers. Among species and treatment combinations, rates of respiration were linearly related to size and relative growth rate, and relationships were comparable among growth environments. Specific respiration rates and whole-plant respiratory CO2 efflux as a proportion of daily net CO2 uptake increased at higher growth temperatures, but were minimally affected by CO2 concentration. Whole-plant specific respiration rates were two to three times higher in broad-leaved than coniferous species. However, compared to faster-growing broad-leaved species, slower-growing conifers lost a larger proportion of net daily CO2 uptake as respiratory CO2 efflux, especially in roots. Interspecific variation in acclimation responses of dark respiration to temperature is more important than acclimation of respiration to CO2 enrichment in modifying tree seedling growth responses to projected increases in CO2 concentration and temperature.},

	Abstract = {A set of sensitivity experiments with the climate system model of intermediate complexity CLIMBER-2 was performed to compare its sensitivity to changes in different types of forcings and boundary conditions with the results of comprehensive models (GCMs). We investigated the climate system response to changes in freshwater flux into the Northern Atlantic, CO2 concentration, solar insolation, and vegetation cover in the boreal zone and in the tropics. All these experiments were compared with the results of corresponding experiments performed with different GCMs. Qualitative, and in many respects, quantitative agreement between the results of CLIMBER-2 and GCMs demonstrate the ability of our climate system model of intermediate complexity to address diverse aspects of the climate change problem. In addition, we used our model for a series of experiments to assess the impact of some climate feedbacks and uncertainties in model parameters on the model sensitivity to different forcings. We studied the role of freshwater feedback and vertical ocean diffusivity for the stability properties of the thermohaline ocean circulation. We show that freshwater feedback plays a minor role, while changes of vertical diffusivity in the ocean considerably affect the circulation stability. In global warming experiments we analysed the impact of hydrological sensitivity and vertical diffusivity on the long-term evolution of the thermohaline circulation. In the boreal and tropical deforestation experiments we assessed the role of an interactive ocean and showed that for both types of deforestation scenarios, an interactive ocean leads to an additional cooling due to albedo and water vapour feedbacks.},

	Abstract = {Physical ecosystem engineers are organisms that directly or indirectly control the availability of resources to other organisms by causing physical state changes in biotic or abiotic materials. Physical ecosystem engineering by organisms is the physical modification, maintenance, or creation of habitats. Ecological effects of engineers on many other species occur in virtually all ecosystems because the physical state changes directly create nonfood resources such as living space, directly control abiotic resources, and indirectly modulate abiotic forces that, in turn, affect resource use by other organisms. Trophic interactions and resource competition do not constitute engineering. Engineering can have significant or trivial effects on other species, may involve the physical structure of an organism (like a tree) or structures made by an organism (like a beaver dam), and can, but does not invariably, have feedback effects on the engineer. We argue that engineering has both negative and positive effects on species richness and abundances at small scales, but the net effects are probably positive at larger scales encompassing engineered and nonengineered environments in ecological and evolutionary space and time. Models of the population dynamics of engineers suggest that the engineer/habitat equilibrium is often, but not always, locally stable and may show long-term cycles, with potential ramifications for community and ecosystem stability. As yet, data adequate to parameterize such a model do not exist for any engineer species. Because engineers control flows of energy and materials but do not have to participate in these flows, energy, mass, and stoichiometry do not appear to be useful in predicting which engineers will have big effects. Empirical observations suggest some potential generalizations about which species will be important engineers in which ecosystems. We point out some of the obvious, and not so obvious, ways in which engineering and trophic relations interact, and we call for greater research on physical ecosystem engineers, their impacts, and their interface with trophic relations.},

Such a sensitivity has been predicted on theoretical terms by Cowan and Farquhar, who postulated that stomata should adjust dynamically to maximize photosynthesis for a given water loss. In this study, we implemented the Cowan and Farquhar hypothesis of optimal stomatal conductivity into a canopy gas exchange model, and predicted the diurnal and daily variability of transpiration for a savanna site in the wet-dry tropics of northern Australia. The predicted transpiration dynamics were then compared with observations at the site using the eddy covariance technique. The observations were also used to evaluate two alternative approaches: constant conductivity and a tuned empirical model. The model based on the optimal water-use hypothesis performed better than the one based on constant stomatal conductivity, and at least as well as the tuned empirical model. This suggests that the optimal water-use hypothesis is useful for modelling canopy gas exchange, and that it can reduce the need for model parameterization.},

	Abstract = {Global climate change has been modifying ecosystem carbon cycling, which has produced feedbacks on climate by affecting the concentration of atmospheric CO2. The importance of biospheric CO2 uptake or release to climate change has generated great interest in quantifying the dynamic responses of terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycling to climate change. However, less attention has been given to Africa, although it accounts for about one-fifth of the global net primary production and is one of the regions that have the greatest climate change. Here we use a biogeochemical model to simulate the dynamic variations in the carbon fluxes and stocks of African ecosystems caused by changes in climate and atmospheric CO2 from 1901 and 1995. We estimate that climate change reduces plant production and soil carbon stocks and causes net CO2 release, but the fertilization effect of increasing atmospheric CO2 on photosynthesis reverses the reduction and leads to carbon accumulation in vegetation. Therefore, the combined effect of climate change and increasing atmospheric CO2 causes net CO2 uptake, particularly in central Africa. The mean rate of the carbon sequestration in the period 1981-1995 is calculated to be 0.34 Gt C yr(-1). Nevertheless, Africa is not necessarily a significant carbon sink, because a large part of the carbon sequestration is offset by the carbon release arising from land use changes.},

	Abstract = {1 We measured above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) and ecosystem structure and processes in eight rain forest stands at four elevations (700, 1700, 2700 and 3100 m) and on two geological substrates (sedimentary vs. ultrabasic rock) on Mount Kinabalu, Borneo. 2 All ultrabasic sites had smaller pools of total soil phosphorus (P) and of labile inorganic P than did the sedimentary sites at the same altitudes. We predicted that the magnitude of altitudinal changes in ANPP would be less on ultrabasic than on sedimentary substrates, reflecting lower temperature dependency of ANPP under stronger P limitation. 3 Although ANPP declined with increasing altitude on both substrates, the slopes of the two regression lines were similar. The intercept was, however, marginally greater on sedimentary than on ultrabasic substrate. 4 Stand-level nutrient-use efficiencies (the ratio of litterfall mass to nutrient return) for N and P were only affected by altitude on ultrabasic substrate where they increased exponentially. Mean foliar N and P contents per unit leaf area of the canopy species increased with altitude on both substrates, but differed between substrates at the same altitude only for P (lower on ultrabasic). 5 Leaf area index (LAI) decreased upslope on both substrates. We assumed that half of primary production was allocated below-ground in order to evaluate stand level net assimilation rate (NAR). This was nearly constant on sedimentary substrate, but declined linearly with increasing altitude on ultrabasic substrate, where it may have to be added to LAI to explain ANPP patterns. 6 We suggest that on sedimentary substrate trees may be able to maintain NAR under colder environments by increasing foliar N and P per unit leaf area, but P deficiency prevents them from adjusting on ultrabasic substrate.},

While these hypotheses have generated numerous reviews and meta-analyses, as well as persistent criticism, two prominent papers have recently concluded that both of these hypotheses should be abandoned because of theoretical weaknesses and failure to predict observed diversity patterns.   I review these criticisms in the context of the continuing tension between logic and empiricism in the development of ecological theory, and conclude that most of the criticisms are misguided because they fail to recognize the inherent connections between these two hypotheses, and consequently fail to test them appropriately.   The logic of every hypothesis is based on the underlying assumptions. In the case of these two hypotheses, the assumptions on which the criticisms of their logic depend are falsified by the strong empirical support for the linked predictions of the hypotheses.  This conclusion calls for a re-evaluation of the basic assumptions upon which most of ecological competition and diversity theory is based.},

	Abstract = {Ongoing and predicted global change makes understanding and predicting species' range shifts an urgent scientific priority. Here, we provide a synthetic perspective on the so far poorly understood effects of interspecific interactions on range expansion rates. We present theoretical foundations for how interspecific interactions may modulate range expansion rates, consider examples from empirical studies of biological invasions and natural range expansions as well as process-based simulations, and discuss how interspecific interactions can be more broadly represented in process-based, spatiotemporally explicit range forecasts. Theory tells us that interspecific interactions affect expansion rates via alteration of local population growth rates and spatial displacement rates, but also via effects on other demographic parameters. The best empirical evidence for interspecific effects on expansion rates comes from studies of biological invasions. Notably, invasion studies indicate that competitive dominance and release from specialized enemies can enhance expansion rates. Studies of natural range expansions especially point to the potential for competition from resident species to reduce expansion rates. Overall, it is clear that interspecific interactions may have important consequences for range dynamics, but also that their effects have received too little attention to robustly generalize on their importance. We then discuss how interspecific interactions effects can be more widely incorporated in dynamic modeling of range expansions. Importantly, models must describe spatiotemporal variation in both local population dynamics and dispersal. Finally, we derive the following guidelines for when it is particularly important to explicitly represent interspecific interactions in dynamic range expansion forecasts: if most interacting species show correlated spatial or temporal trends in their effects on the target species, if the number of interacting species is low, and if the abundance of one or more strongly interacting species is not closely linked to the abundance of the target species.},

@article{hurtt_consequences_1995,
	Abstract = {Plant competition for space is studied using analytical and simulation models. Here, the interaction is viewed as a local competition between juveniles of different species for environmentally variable sites vacated by the random deaths of adults. Because plants are sedentary and have finite fecundity, often only a subset of species will compete for an available site. When a dominant species is recruitment limited, inferior competitors will win some site's by forfeit. It is shown that recruitment limitation allows ''winning-by-forfeit'' which lessens the effect of competitive asymmetries and slows population and community dynamics. Moreover, since recruitment limitation is likely to be most pronounced in highly diverse communities because of the rarity of many species, it is suggested that there is no conflict between the hypothesis that species-rich plant communities are more influenced by chance and history than regulated by competition, and observations of strong interspecific differences among plants.

	Abstract = {Tipping points, at which complex systems can shift abruptly from one state to another, are notoriously difficult to predict(1). Theory proposes that early warning signals may be based on the phenomenon that recovery rates from small perturbations should tend to zero when approaching a tipping point(2,3); however, evidence that this happens in living systems is lacking. Here we test such 'critical slowing down' using a microcosmin which photo-inhibition drives a cyanobacterial population to a classical tipping point when a critical light level is exceeded. We show that over a large range of conditions, recovery from small perturbations becomes slower as the system comes closer to the critical point. In addition, autocorrelation in the subtle fluctuations of the system's state rose towards the tipping point, supporting the idea that this metric can be used as an indirect indicator of slowing down(4,5). Although stochasticity prohibits prediction of the timing of critical transitions, our results suggest that indicators of slowing down may be used to rank complex systems on a broad scale from resilient to fragile.},

@article{possingham_fire_1995,
	Abstract = {We construct a model of a multispecies forest that is often affected by major fires and explicitly incorporates life-history attributes of trees that are related to fire-flammability and susceptibility to fire. The model is used to explore coexistence mechanisms in forests; two fire-dependent coexistence mechanisms were identified. The first allows coexistence along a temporal axis since the last fire; this niche axis is well documented in the literature. The second coexistence mechanism relies on the influence of tree flammability on the incidence of fires and/or tree reproductive success. This ''flammability niche'' is explored in detail, with particular reference to eucalypt forests in Australia and Tasmania. Using the technique of linearized stability analysis about a positive equilibrium, we explored the local stability of assemblages with randomly generated life-history attributes. A robust and testable prediction of the model is that two species of fire-adapted tree are likely to coexist with a late-successional species if their flammabilities are very different, and if the most flammable species is more susceptible to fire but less likely to die as a result of non-fire causes. Our results have implications for managing fire-dependent ecosystems to maintain biodiversity. Although the motivation for this paper is observations on Australian eucalypt forests, the principles of coexistence that we discuss apply to all fire-prone forest and woodland ecosystems.},

	Abstract = {By coupling an atmospheric general circulation model asynchronously with an equilibrium vegetation model, manifold equilibrium solutions of the atmosphere-biosphere system have been explored. It is found that under present-day conditions of the Earth's orbital parameters and sea-surface temperatures, two stable equilibria of vegetation patterns are possible: one corresponding to present-day sparse vegetation in the Sahel, the second solution yielding savannah which extends far into the south-western part of the Sahara. A similar picture is obtained for conditions during the last glacial maximum (21 000 years before present (BP)). For the mid-Holocene (6000 years BP), however, the model finds only one solution: the green Sahara. We suggest that this intransitive behaviour of the atmosphere-biosphere is related to a westward shift of the Hadley-Walker circulation. A conceptual model of atmosphere-vegetation dynamics is used to interpret the bifurcation as well as its change in terms of stability theory.},

Spaceborne lidar sensors collect data along transects and gain value for the global change science community when combined with data sources that have complete horizontal coverage. Data sources and methods for this type of analysis require evaluation. In this work we use image segmentation of 500 m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to produce a global map of 4.4 million forest patches. Where a Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) transect intersects a patch, its height is calculated from the GLAS observations directly. Regression analysis is then used to estimate the heights of those patches without GLAS observations. Regression goodness-of-fit statistics indicate moderately strong relationships for predicting the 90th percentile patch height, with a mean RMSE of 5.9 m and mean correlation (R-2) of 0.67.

	Abstract = {To assess the impacts of land-use changes on plant-available water (PAW) and evapotranspiration (ET), volumetric water content (VWC) was measured to 8 m beneath three, adjacent ecosystems for four years (1991--1994). Estimates of PAW, ET, and deep drainage were generated for mature evergreen forest, adjacent pasture, and capoeira (second-growth forest on abandoned pasture land). PAW between 0 and 8 m depth for forest, pasture, and capoeira ranged from a low of 56, 400, and 138 mm at the end of the 1992 dry season to a high of 941, 1116, and 1021 mm during the 1994 wet season. We found significant differences in deep (4--8 m) stocks of PAW when comparing pasture with both forest types. In contrast, mature forest and capoeira PAW were not significantly different from one another at any depth during the experiment. In all three ecosystems available soil moisture from 4--8 m was depleted during the 1991 dry season by plant water uptake and was not recharged to 1991 levels until 1994 due to an intervening 2-year, El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation event. Water balance estimates (based on measurements to 8 m) showed an average 10\% decrease in ET from pasture compared to mature forest. Less than 15 years after pasture abandonment, ET in second-growth forest recovered to rates nearly equaling the mature forest rate. In seasonally dry environments annual and interannual cycles of deep soil moisture recharge and depletion influence rates of transpiration and drainage. These deep cycles are not currently incorporated in models of regional and global moisture flux.},

@article{schwinning_hierarchy_2004,
	Abstract = {In arid/semi-arid ecosystems, biological resources, such as water, soil nutrients, and plant biomass, typically go through periods of high and low abundance. Short periods of high resource abundance are usually triggered by rainfall events, which, despite of the overall scarcity of rain, can saturate the resource demand of some biological processes for a time. This review develops the idea that there exists a hierarchy of soil moisture pulse events with a corresponding hierarchy of ecological responses, such that small pulses only trigger a small number of relatively minor ecological events, and larger pulses trigger a more inclusive set and some larger ecological events. This framework hinges on the observation that many biological state changes, where organisms transition from a state of lower to higher physiological activity, require a minimal triggering event size. Response thresholds are often determined by the ability of organisms to utilize soil moisture pulses of different infiltration depth or duration. For example, brief, shallow pulses can only affect surface dwelling organisms with fast response times and high tolerance for low resource levels, such as some species of the soil micro-fauna and -flora, while it takes more water and deeper infiltration to affect the physiology, growth or reproduction of higher plants. This review first discusses how precipitation, climate and site factors translate into soil moisture pulses of varying magnitude and duration. Next, the idea of the response hierarchy for ecosystem processes is developed, followed by an exploration of the possible evolutionary background for the existence of response thresholds to resource pulses. The review concludes with an outlook on global change: does the hierarchical view of precipitation effects in ecosystems provide new perspectives on the future of arid/semiarid lands?},

@article{van_der_putten_empirical_2009,
	Abstract = {A growing body of evidence shows that aboveground and belowground communities and processes are intrinsically linked, and that feedbacks between these subsystems have important implications for community structure and ecosystem functioning. Almost all studies on this topic have been carried out from an empirical perspective and in specific ecological settings or contexts. Belowground interactions operate at different spatial and temporal scales. Due to the relatively low mobility and high survival of organisms in the soil, plants have longer lasting legacy effects belowground than aboveground. Our current challenge is to understand how aboveground-belowground biotic interactions operate across spatial and temporal scales, and how they depend on, as well as influence, the abiotic environment. Because empirical capacities are too limited to explore all possible combinations of interactions and environmental settings, we explore where and how they can be supported by theoretical approaches to develop testable predictions and to generalise empirical results. We review four key areas where a combined aboveground-belowground approach offers perspectives for enhancing ecological understanding, namely succession, agro-ecosystems, biological invasions and global change impacts on ecosystems. In plant succession, differences in scales between aboveground and belowground biota, as well as between species interactions and ecosystem processes, have important implications for the rate and direction of community change. Aboveground as well as belowground interactions either enhance or reduce rates of plant species replacement. Moreover, the outcomes of the interactions depend on abiotic conditions and plant life history characteristics, which may vary with successional position. We exemplify where translation of the current conceptual succession models into more predictive models can help targeting empirical studies and generalising their results. Then, we discuss how understanding succession may help to enhance managing arable crops, grasslands and invasive plants, as well as provide insights into the effects of global change on community re-organisation and ecosystem processes.},

	Abstract = {Competition between plants that differ in root-shoot allocation has been modelled using consumer-resource equations where competition occurs only through the utilization of resources. Provided that such models can be put into an evolutionary game setting, we show that conditions for coexistence can be analysed using the ESS maximum principle from evolutionary game theory. We demonstrate this approach using a modified version of a consumer-resource model from Reynolds \& Pacala (1993). Allocation of biomass by the consumers to root or shoot is expressed as an evolutionary strategy. Since stability conditions are defined by the ESS maximum principle, aspects of coexistence can be determined without analyses of Jacobian matrices. Using the ESS maximum principle, we confirm that coexistence between two or more species is not possible with this model. We show that this result depends on the consumer growth rate being a linear function of allocation strategy and does not depend on the form of the (nonlinear) nutrient and light availability equations. In addition, we show that species coexistence is possible if the model is modified to include a nonlinear dependence of consumer growth rate on allocation strategy. We give an example where coexistence between two species is obtained. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited},

	Abstract = {Changes in climate and land use that interact synergistically to increase fire frequencies and intensities in tropical regions are predicted to drive forests to new grass-dominated stable states. To reveal the mechanisms for such a transition, we established 50 ha plots in a transitional forest in the southwestern Brazilian Amazon to different fire treatments (unburned, burned annually (B1yr) or at 3-year intervals (B3yr)). Over an 8-year period since the commencement of these treatments, we documented: (i) the annual rate of pasture and native grass invasion in response to increasing fire frequency; (ii) the establishment of Brachiaria decumbens (an African C4 grass) as a function of decreasing canopy cover and (iii) the effects of grass fine fuel on fire intensity. Grasses invaded approximately 200 m from the edge into the interiors of burned plots (B1yr: 4.31 ha; B3yr: 4.96 ha) but invaded less than 10 m into the unburned plot (0.33 ha). The probability of B. decumbens establishment increased with seed availability and decreased with leaf area index. Fine fuel loads along the forest edge were more than three times higher in grass-dominated areas, which resulted in especially intense fires. Our results indicate that synergies between fires and invasive C4 grasses jeopardize the future of tropical forests.},

@article{shevliakova_carbon_2009,
	Abstract = {We have developed a dynamic land model (LM3V) able to simulate ecosystem dynamics and exchanges of water, energy, and CO2 between land and atmosphere. LM3V is specifically designed to address the consequences of land use and land management changes including cropland and pasture dynamics, shifting cultivation, logging, fire, and resulting patterns of secondary regrowth. Here we analyze the behavior of LM3V, forced with the output from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) atmospheric model AM2, observed precipitation data, and four historic scenarios of land use change for 1700--2000. Our analysis suggests a net terrestrial carbon source due to land use activities from 1.1 to 1.3 GtC/a during the 1990s, where the range is due to the difference in the historic cropland distribution. This magnitude is substantially smaller than previous estimates from other models, largely due to our estimates of a secondary vegetation sink of 0.35 to 0.6 GtC/a in the 1990s and decelerating agricultural land clearing since the 1960s. For the 1990s, our estimates for the pastures' carbon flux vary from a source of 0.37 to a sink of 0.15 GtC/a, and for the croplands our model shows a carbon source of 0.6 to 0.9 GtC/a. Our process-based model suggests a smaller net deforestation source than earlier bookkeeping models because it accounts for decelerated net conversion of primary forest to agriculture and for stronger secondary vegetation regrowth in tropical regions. The overall uncertainty is likely to be higher than the range reported here because of uncertainty in the biomass recovery under changing ambient conditions, including atmospheric CO2 concentration, nutrients availability, and climate.},

@article{young_density_2010,
	Abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Southern Africa's 'elephant problem' is often attributed to an overabundance of elephants (Loxodonta africana) in conservation areas. Paradoxically, the African elephant is listed as 'vulnerable' (IUCN Redlist) despite occupying a large geographical range and numbering about 600 000. How densities influence elephant populations is therefore important for conservation management decisions, particularly because a move towards non-equilibrium management of savannas implies a need for elephant populations to fluctuate in response to variation in intrinsic (demographic) and extrinsic (resource) factors. 2. A study on one of the world's largest elephant populations demonstrated that population regulation is driven by a spatial response to water availability, environmental stochasticity and density. The challenge remains to identify the demographic and behavioural variables that drive density dependence. 3. We evaluated whether the movements of elephant family groups from 13 populations across a wide resource gradient were explained by variability in primary productivity, rainfall and population density. We then assessed whether density-related movements explained variability in juvenile survival, hence inferring a spatially driven behavioural mechanism that may explain density-dependent population growth. We also analysed whether management actions modified this mechanism. 4. In the dry season, daily-displacement distances (DDDs) increased non-linearly with density, and declined with increased vegetation productivity and previous wet season rainfall. In the wet season, DDDs were primarily explained by vegetation productivity. 5. The survival of weaned calves (4-7 years) decreased with increasing dry season DDDs, but this did not hold for suckling calves (1-3 years) or sub-adults (8-11 years). 6. Fences and supplementary water modified the shape and strength of relationships between DDDs and densities, vegetation productivity and rainfall and negated the relationships between DDDs and weaned calf survival. 7. We suggest that density dependence in weaned calf survival is driven by the response of dry season roaming activities of family groups to variations in density, rainfall and the distribution of food. Fences and supplementary water that alter this mechanism may contribute to the relatively high population growth rates of some populations.},

	Abstract = {One of the most common descriptors of the relationship between root and shoot biomass is the root : shoot ratio, which has become a core method for estimating root biomass from the more easily measured shoot biomass. Previous reviews have examined root : shoot ratio data, but have only considered particular vegetation types and have not always critically reviewed the data used. Reliable root : shoot ratios are needed for a wide range of vegetation types in order to improve the accuracy of root biomass estimates, including those required for estimating the effects of land management and land use change in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.This study reviewed root : shoot ratios in terrestrial biomes. A key facet of our analysis was a critical methodological review, through which unreliable data were identified and omitted on the basis of specific criteria. Of the 786 root : shoot ratio observations collated, 62\% were omitted because of inadequate or unverifiable root sampling methods. When only the reliable data were examined, root : shoot ratios were found to be negatively related to shoot biomass, mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature, forest stand age, and forest stand height.Although a single allometric equation derived in this study reliably predicted root biomass from shoot biomass for forests and woodlands, in general, the use of vegetation-specific root : shoot ratios were found to be a more accurate method for predicting root biomass. When the root : shoot ratio data collated here were applied to an analysis of the global carbon budget, there was a 50\% increase in estimated global root carbon stock, and a 12\% increase in estimated total carbon stock of terrestrial vegetation. The use of the vegetation-specific root : shoot ratios presented in this study is likely to substantially improve the accuracy of root biomass estimates for purposes such as carbon accounting and for studies of ecosystem dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Aim  Africa is expected to face severe changes in climatic conditions. Our objectives are: (1) to model trends and the extent of future biome shifts that may occur by 2050, (2) to model a trend in tree cover change, while accounting for human impact, and (3) to evaluate uncertainty in future climate projections. Location  West Africa. Methods  We modelled the potential future spatial distribution of desert, grassland, savanna, deciduous and evergreen forest in West Africa using six bioclimatic models. Future tree cover change was analysed with generalized additive models (GAMs). We used climate data from 17 general circulation models (GCMs) and included human population density and fire intensity to model tree cover. Consensus projections were derived via weighted averages to: (1) reduce inter-model variability, and (2) describe trends extracted from different GCM projections. Results  The strongest predicted effect of climate change was on desert and grasslands, where the bioclimatic envelope of grassland is projected to expand into the desert by an area of 2 million km2. While savannas are predicted to contract in the south (by 54 $\pm$ 22 × 104 km2), deciduous and evergreen forest biomes are expected to expand (64 $\pm$ 13 × 104 km2 and 77 $\pm$ 26 × 104 km2). However, uncertainty due to different GCMs was particularly high for the grassland and the evergreen biome shift. Increasing tree cover (1--10\%) was projected for large parts of Benin, Burkina Faso, C{\^o}te d'Ivoire, Ghana and Togo, but a decrease was projected for coastal areas (1--20\%). Furthermore, human impact negatively affected tree cover and partly changed the direction of the projected change from increase to decrease. Main conclusions  Considering climate change alone, the model results of potential vegetation (biomes) show a `greening' trend by 2050. However, the modelled effects of human impact suggest future forest degradation. Thus, it is essential to consider both climate change and human impact in order to generate realistic future tree cover projections.},

	Abstract = {* *Large proportions of the Earth's land surface are covered by biomes dominated by C4 grasses. These C4-dominated biomes originated during the late Miocene, 3--8 million years ago (Ma), but there is evidence that C4 grasses evolved some 20 Ma earlier during the early Miocene/Oligocene. Explanations for this lag between evolution and expansion invoke changes in atmospheric CO2, seasonality of climate and fire. However, there is still no consensus about which of these factors triggered C4 grassland expansion.
* *We use a vegetation model, the adaptive dynamic global vegetation model (aDGVM), to test how CO2, temperature, precipitation, fire and the tolerance of vegetation to fire influence C4 grassland expansion. Simulations are forced with late Miocene climates generated with the Hadley Centre coupled ocean--atmosphere--vegetation general circulation model.
* *We show that physiological differences between the C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathways cannot explain C4 grass invasion into forests, but that fire is a crucial driver. Fire-promoting plant traits serve to expand the climate space in which C4-dominated biomes can persist.
* *We propose that three mechanisms were involved in C4 expansion: the physiological advantage of C4 grasses under low atmospheric CO2 allowed them to invade C3 grasslands; fire allowed grasses to invade forests; and the evolution of fire-resistant savanna trees expanded the climate space that savannas can invade.},

@article{medlyn_reconciling_2011,
	Abstract = {Models of vegetation function are widely used to predict the effects of climate change on carbon, water and nutrient cycles of terrestrial ecosystems, and their feedbacks to climate. Stomatal conductance, the process that governs plant water use and carbon uptake, is fundamental to such models. In this paper, we reconcile two long-standing theories of stomatal conductance. The empirical approach, which is most commonly used in vegetation models, is phenomenological, based on experimental observations of stomatal behaviour in response to environmental conditions. The optimal approach is based on the theoretical argument that stomata should act to minimize the amount of water used per unit carbon gained. We reconcile these two approaches by showing that the theory of optimal stomatal conductance can be used to derive a model of stomatal conductance that is closely analogous to the empirical models. Consequently, we obtain a unified stomatal model which has a similar form to existing empirical models, but which now provides a theoretical interpretation for model parameter values. The key model parameter, g(1), is predicted to increase with growth temperature and with the marginal water cost of carbon gain. The new model is fitted to a range of datasets ranging from tropical to boreal trees. The parameter g(1) is shown to vary with growth temperature, as predicted, and also with plant functional type. The model is shown to correctly capture responses of stomatal conductance to changing atmospheric CO2, and thus can be used to test for stomatal acclimation to elevated CO2. The reconciliation of the optimal and empirical approaches to modelling stomatal conductance is important for global change biology because it provides a simple theoretical framework for analyzing, and simulating, the coupling between carbon and water cycles under environmental change.},

However, food sharing can be a more general phenomenon accounted for by more parsimonious, mutualistic explanations. We propose a game theoretical model of a general sharing situation in which food owners share because it is in their own self-interest--they avoid high costs associated with beggar harassment. When beggars harass, owners may benefit from sharing part of the food if their consumption rate is low relative to the rate of cost accrual. Our model predicts that harassment can be a profitable strategy for beggars if they reap some direct benefits from harassing other than shared food (such as picking up scraps). Therefore, beggars may manipulate the owner's fitness payoffs in such a way as to make sharing mutualistic.},

@article{hutley_sub-continental_2011,
	Abstract = {Savanna landscapes across north Australia are characterised by limited topographic variation, and in the Northern Territory, by a relatively constant decline in rainfall with distance inland. The North Australian Tropical Transect (NATT) traverses this 1000 km gradient of largely intact vegetation which provides an ideal 'living laboratory' and framework to investigate the influence of vegetation structural and floristic change and climate drivers on land-atmosphere exchange at a regional scale. We conducted a multidisciplinary program examining carbon, water and energy fluxes as a function of climate and vegetation change along a sub-continental environmental gradient. Initial findings are reported in this Special Issue. During the program, an intensive field campaign was undertaken during the dry season to characterise vegetation and soil properties of eight flux tower sites used to describe spatial and temporal dynamics of fluxes across this gradient. This paper provides an overview of the savanna landscapes of north Australia detailing vegetation structural and physiological change along this gradient. Above-ground woody biomass, stem density, overstorey LAI and canopy height declined along sites that spanned an 1100 mm annual rainfall gradient. Biomass ranged from 35 to 5 t C ha(-1) with dry season LAI ranging from similar to 1 to 0.05 across savanna sites both intact and cleared for grazing. Across open-forest and woodland savanna, basal area ranged from 9.7 to 5.3 m(2) ha(-1). While structural change was significant and correlated with rainfall, leaf scale physiological properties (maximal photosynthesis, V-cmax. C-i/C-a, light use efficiency) of the dominant woody species showed little variation, despite the significant environmental gradient. It is likely that changes in structural properties dominate spatial patterns of flux as opposed to physiological plasticity or species differences along this gradient. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {Abstract Two inverse methods are applied to a land surface model to infer global patterns of the hydrologically active depth of the vegetation's rooting zone. The first method is based on the assumption that vegetation is optimally adapted to its environment, resulting in a maximization of net carbon uptake [net primary production (NPP)]. This method is implemented by adjusting the depth such that the simulated NPP of the model is at a maximum. The second method assumes that water availability directly affects the leaf area of the vegetation, and therefore the amount of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR). Rooting depth in the model is adjusted such that the mismatch between simulated and satellite-derived APAR is at a minimum. The inferred patterns of rooting zone depth from both methods correspond well and reproduce the broad patterns of rooting depth derived from observations. Comparison to rooting depth estimates from root biomass distributions point out that these may underestimate the hydrological significance of deep rooted vegetation in the Tropics with potential consequences for large-scale land surface and climate model simulations.},

@article{sperry_safety_2008,
	Abstract = {Tree hydraulic architecture exhibits patterns that propagate from tissue to tree scales. A challenge is to make sense of these patterns in terms of trade-offs and adaptations. The universal trend for conduits per area to decrease with increasing conduit diameter below the theoretical packing limit may reflect the compromise between maximizing the area for conduction versus mechanical support and storage. Variation in conduit diameter may have two complementary influences: one being compromises between efficiency and safety and the other being that conduit tapering within a tree maximizes conductance per growth investment. Area-preserving branching may be a mechanical constraint, preventing otherwise more efficient top-heavy trees. In combination, these trends beget another: trees have more, narrower conduits moving from trunks to terminal branches. This pattern: (1) increases the efficiency of tree water conduction; (2) minimizes (but does not eliminate) any hydraulic limitation on the productivity or tissue growth with tree height; and (3) is consistent with the scaling of tree conductance and sap flow with size. We find no hydraulic reason why tree height should scale with a basal diameter to the two-thirds power as recently claimed; it is probably another mechanical constraint as originally proposed. The buffering effect of capacitance on the magnitude of transpiration-induced xylem tension appears to be coupled to cavitation resistance, possibly alleviating safety versus efficiency trade-offs.},

@article{wiegand_patch-dynamics_2006,
	Abstract = {The coexistence of woody and grassy plants in savannas has often been attributed to a rooting-niche separation (two-layer hypothesis). Water was assumed to be the limiting resource for both growth forms and grasses were assumed to extract water from the upper soil layer and trees and bushes from the lower layers. Woody plant encroachment (i.e. an increase in density of woody plants often unpalatable to domestic livestock) is a serious problem in many savannas and is believed to be the result of overgrazing in 'two-layer systems'. Recent research has questioned the universality of both the two-layer hypothesis and the hypothesis that overgrazing is the cause of woody plant encroachment. We present an alternative hypothesis explaining both tree-grass coexistence and woody plant encroachment in and savannas. We propose that woody plant encroachment is part of a cyclical succession between open savanna and woody dominance and is driven by two factors: rainfall that is highly variable in space and time, and inter-tree competition. In this case, savanna landscapes are composed of many patches (a few hectares in size) in different states of transition between grassy and woody dominance, i.e. we hypothesize that and savannas are patch-dynamic systems. We summarize patterns of tree distribution observed in an arid savanna in Namibia and show that these patterns are in agreement with the patch-dynamic savanna hypothesis. We discuss the applicability of this hypothesis to fire-dominated savannas, in which rainfall variability is low and fire drives spatial heterogeneity. We conclude that field studies are more likely to contribute to a general understanding of tree-grass coexistence and woody plant encroachment if they consider both primary (rain and nutrients) and secondary (fire and grazing) determinants of patch properties across different savannas.

@article{fletcher_cost_2009,
	Abstract = {The determination of an individual's behaviour often relies upon complex signals that convey messages about the environment it inhabits. In aquatic environments such signals take varied and conflicting forms including chemical cues indicating food or potential mates being opposed by the presence of competitor or predator odour. Despite ever increasing knowledge of the chemical nature of signalling compounds, little is known of how the environment affects an animal's response towards such infochemicals. We examined how the European shore crab, Carcinus maenas, changes its behaviour in relation to recent social interactions. We hypothesized that agonistic encounters would affect males' behaviour towards two chemical signals: the female sex pheromone cue and a feeding odour (mussel-infused water). In a laboratory experiment, agonistic encounters significantly increased males' response times to food stimuli regardless of their dominance status. Additionally, after an aggressive interaction, 40\% of subordinate males failed to respond, and both winners and losers showed a delayed response, to the female sex pheromone. Status-dependent responses by males are potential signs of social structures, enabling them to use social hierarchy-driven mating tactics. This could reduce the number and intensity of costly fights during the short reproductive window. This is a rare example of social interactions directly affecting an animal's response to chemical cues for feeding and reproduction, opening the field for further studies on the complexity of chemical communication.},

@article{liu_formosaic:_1998,
	Abstract = {A forest is embedded in heterogeneous landscape mosaics and interacts with the surrounding environment through processes such as seed dispersal. Previous forest models, however, have either ignored such interactions or made unrealistic assumptions. We developed a landscape model (FORMOSAIC) that explicitly considers not only the dynamics of a focal forest but also ecological impacts of adjacent areas on the focal forest. FORMOSAIC is hierarchically structured, spatially explicit, multi-scale, stochastic, and individual-based. It integrates information of tree position, regeneration, growth, death, spatial interaction, and environmental factors. Data for parameterizing FORMOSAIC were mainly from a 50 ha permanent study plot in the Pasoh forest reserve (Malaysia), which contained over 800 tree species and more than 330 000 trees with diameter at breast height (dbh) greater than or equal to 1.0 cm. Model simulation results agreed well with independent field census data in terms of species richness, species composition, tree abundance, and basal area at two spatial scales. Sensitivity analysis indicated that minimum harvest size was the most sensitive parameter. Species richness was particularly sensitive to the duration of seed immigration from species-rich surrounding forests. For tree abundance and basal area, the second most sensitive parameters varied at two spatial scales. Through uncertainty analysis we found that many parameters had scale-dependent and non-linear relationships with species richness, tree abundance, and basal area. There also existed significant interactive effects between parameters. The model could be a useful tool for addressing important issues such as fragmentation and deforestation in forest management for species diversity and timber production from a landscape perspective.

@article{cushing_chaotic_2001,
	Abstract = {Chaos has now been documented in a laboratory population. In controlled laboratory experiments, cultures of flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum) undergo bifurcations in their dynamics as demographic parameters are manipulated. These bifurcations, including a specific route to chaos, are predicted by a well-validated deterministic model called the "LPA model". The LPA model isl based on the nonlinear interactions among the life cycle stages of the beetle (larva, pupa and adult). A stochastic version of the model accounts for the deviations of data from the deterministic model and provides the means for parameterization and rigorous statistical validation. The chaotic attractor of the deterministic LPA model and the stationary distribution of the stochastic LPA model describe the experimental data in phase space with striking accuracy. In addition, model-predicted temporal patterns on the attractor are observed in the data. This paper gives a brief account of the interdisciplinary effort that obtained these results.

	Abstract = {Amazon forests, which store ∼50\% of tropical forest carbon and play a vital role in global water, energy, and carbon cycling, are predicted to experience both longer and more intense dry seasons by the end of the 21st century. However, the climate sensitivity of this ecosystem remains uncertain: several studies have predicted large-scale die-back of the Amazon, whereas several more recent studies predict that the biome will remain largely intact. Combining remote-sensing and ground-based observations with a size- and age-structured terrestrial ecosystem model, we explore the sensitivity and ecological resilience of these forests to changes in climate. We demonstrate that water stress operating at the scale of individual plants, combined with spatial variation in soil texture, explains observed patterns of variation in ecosystem biomass, composition, and dynamics across the region, and strongly influences the ecosystem's resilience to changes in dry season length. Specifically, our analysis suggests that in contrast to existing predictions of either stability or catastrophic biomass loss, the Amazon forest's response to a drying regional climate is likely to be an immediate, graded, heterogeneous transition from high-biomass moist forests to transitional dry forests and woody savannah-like states. Fire, logging, and other anthropogenic disturbances may, however, exacerbate these climate change-induced ecosystem transitions.},

	Abstract = {* 1Water is a key resource in tropical savannas. Changes in vegetation structure due to land-use change and increased fire frequency may affect the availability of water and the flux of water through these ecosystems.
* 2We compared the seasonal soil moisture dynamics of two adjacent savanna ecosystems with contrasting tree densities in central Brazil. Our goal was to investigate the influence of tree density on deep water uptake, soil water dynamics and evapotranspiration.
* 3Soil water was measured using a depth of 7·5 m beneath the tree-dominated cerrado denso ecosystem and to 4 m beneath the grass-dominated campo sujo ecosystem. Plant-available water (PAW) throughout the cerrado denso soil profile ranged from 293 mm at the end of the dry season to 689 mm during the wet season. In the grass-dominated site, PAW in the profile ranged from 155 to 362 mm.
* 4During the dry season, ≈82\% of the water used in cerrado denso and 67\% in campo sujo was extracted from the profile below 1 m. The tree-dominated cerrado denso used 137 mm more water than the grass-dominated campo sujo. Significant deep soil water uptake was also observed during the wet season of 1998, when rainfall was below average.
* 5Evapotranspiration (ET) rates (estimated as change in soil moisture over time) were higher in cerrado denso than in campo sujo during both seasons. Estimated ET ranged from 1·4 mm day−1 during the dry season to 5·8 mm day−1 for the wet season in cerrado denso, and from 0·9 mm day−1 in the dry season to 4·5 mm day−1 in early wet season in campo sujo. The differences in PAW and ET rates between the two ecosystems are associated not only with differences in root distribution, but also with differences in tree densities and the phenology of full-leaf canopies.
* 6Our results suggest that deep-rooted plants may contribute significantly to the water balance of cerrado ecosystems, and that the hydrological cycle of this biome could change as woody vegetation is replaced by exotic grasses and agricultural crops.},

@article{nepstad_mortality_2007,
	Abstract = {Severe drought episodes such as those associated with El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events influence large areas of tropical forest and may become more frequent in the future. One of the most important forest responses to severe drought is tree mortality, which alters forest structure, composition, carbon content, and flammability, and which varies widely. This study tests the hypothesis that tree mortality increases abruptly during drought episodes when plant-available soil water (PAW) declines below a critical minimum threshold. It also examines the effect of tree size, plant life form (palm, liana, tree) and potential canopy position (understory, midcanopy, overstory) on drought-induced plant mortality. A severe, four-year drought episode was simulated by excluding 60\% of incoming throughfall during each wet season using plastic panels installed in the understory of a 1-ha forest treatment plot, while a 1-ha control plot received normal rainfall. After 3.2 years, the treatment resulted in a 38\% increase in mortality rates across all stems {\textgreater}2 cm dbh. Mortality rates increased 4.5-fold among large trees ({\textgreater}30 cm dbh) and twofold among medium trees (10--30 cm dbh) in response to the treatment, whereas the smallest stems were less responsive. Recruitment rates did not compensate for the elevated mortality of larger-diameter stems in the treatment plot. Overall, lianas proved more susceptible to drought-induced mortality than trees or palms, and potential overstory tree species were more vulnerable than midcanopy and understory species. Large stems contributed to 90\% of the pretreatment live aboveground biomass in both plots. Large-tree mortality resulting from the treatment generated 3.4 times more dead biomass than the control plot. The dramatic mortality response suggests significant, adverse impacts on the global carbon cycle if climatic changes follow current trends.},

@article{brienen_long-term_2015,
	Abstract = {Atmospheric carbon dioxide records indicate that the land surface has acted as a strong global carbon sink over recent decades, with a substantial fraction of this sink probably located in the tropics, particularly in the Amazon. Nevertheless, it is unclear how the terrestrial carbon sink will evolve as climate and atmospheric composition continue to change. Here we analyse the historical evolution of the biomass dynamics of the Amazon rainforest over three decades using a distributed network of 321 plots. While this analysis confirms that Amazon forests have acted as a long-term net biomass sink, we find a long-term decreasing trend of carbon accumulation. Rates of net increase in above-ground biomass declined by one-third during the past decade compared to the 1990s. This is a consequence of growth rate increases levelling off recently, while biomass mortality persistently increased throughout, leading to a shortening of carbon residence times. Potential drivers for the mortality increase include greater climate variability, and feedbacks of faster growth on mortality, resulting in shortened tree longevity. The observed decline of the Amazon sink diverges markedly from the recent increase in terrestrial carbon uptake at the global scale, and is contrary to expectations based on models.},

	Abstract = {Ecosystem and community ecology have evolved along different pathways, with little overlap. However, to meet societal demands for predicting changes in ecosystem services, the functional and structural view dominating these two branches of ecology, respectively, must be integrated. Biodiversity--ecosystem function research has addressed this integration for two decades, but full integration that makes predictions relevant to practical problems is still lacking. We argue that full integration requires going, in both branches, deeper by taking into account individual organisms and the evolutionary and physico-chemical principles that drive their behavior. Individual-based models are a major tool for this integration. They have matured by using individual-level mechanism to replace the demographic thinking which dominates classical theoretical ecology. Existing individual-based ecosystem models already have proven useful both for theory and application. Still, next-generation individual-based models will increasingly use standardized and re-usable submodels to represent behaviors and mechanisms such as growth, uptake of nutrients, foraging, and home range behavior. The strategy of pattern-oriented modeling then helps make such ecosystem models structurally realistic by developing theory for individual behaviors just detailed enough to reproduce and explain patterns observed at the system level. Next-generation ecosystem scientists should include the individual-based approach in their toolkit and focus on addressing real systems because theory development and solving applied problems go hand-in-hand in individual-based ecology.},

	Abstract = {Hydrologic analyses often involve the evaluation of soil water infiltration, conductivity, storage, and plant-water relationships. To define the hydrologic soil water effects requires estimating soil water characteristics for water potential and hydraulic conductivity using soil variables such as texture, organic matter (OM), and structure. Field or laboratory measurements are difficult, costly, and often impractical for many hydrologic analyses. Statistical correlations between soil texture, soil water potential, and hydraulic conductivity can provide estimates sufficiently accurate for many analyses and decisions. This study developed new soil water characteristic equations from the currently available USDA soil database using only the readily available variables of soil texture and OM. These equations are similar to those previously reported by Saxton et al. but include more variables and application range. They were combined with previously reported relationships for tensions and conductivities and the effects of density, gravel, and salinity to form a comprehensive predictive system of soil water characteristics for agricultural water management and hydrologic analyses. Verification was performed using independent data sets for a wide range of soil textures. The predictive system was programmed for a graphical computerized model to provide easy application and rapid solutions and is available at http://hydrolab.arsusda.gov/soilwater/Index.htm},

This two-part function---together with a power function relating soil moisture and hydraulic conductivity---is used to derive a formula for the wetting front suction required by the Green-Ampt equation. Representative parameters for the moisture characteristic, the wetting front suction, and the sorptivity, a parameter in the infiltration equation derived by Philip (1957), are computed by using the desorption data of Holtan et al. (1968). Average values of the parameters, and associated standard deviations, are calculated for 11 soil textural classes.

@article{verhoef_modeling_2014,
	Abstract = {Accurate estimates of how soil water stress affects plant transpiration are crucial for reliable land surface model (LSM) predictions. Current LSMs generally use a water stress factor, β, dependent on soil moisture content, θ, that ranges linearly between β = 1 for unstressed vegetation and β = 0 when wilting point is reached. This paper explores the feasibility of replacing the current approach with equations that use soil water potential as their independent variable, or with a set of equations that involve hydraulic and chemical signaling, thereby ensuring feedbacks between the entire soil--root--xylem--leaf system. A comparison with the original linear θ-based water stress parameterization, and with its improved curvi-linear version, was conducted. Assessment of model suitability was focused on their ability to simulate the correct (as derived from experimental data) curve shape of relative transpiration versus fraction of transpirable soil water. We used model sensitivity analyses under progressive soil drying conditions, employing two commonly used approaches to calculate water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves. Furthermore, for each of these hydraulic parameterizations we used two different parameter sets, for 3 soil texture types; a total of 12 soil hydraulic permutations. Results showed that the resulting transpiration reduction functions (TRFs) varied considerably among the models. The fact that soil hydraulic conductivity played a major role in the model that involved hydraulic and chemical signaling led to unrealistic values of β, and hence TRF, for many soil hydraulic parameter sets. However, this model is much better equipped to simulate the behavior of different plant species. Based on these findings, we only recommend implementation of this approach into LSMs if great care with choice of soil hydraulic parameters is taken.},

Plots in the Guiana Shield area (and eastern Amazonia) usually havelower diversity than those in central or western Amazonia. It is argued thatthis is not because of low rainfall or low nutrient status of the soil butbecause of the small area of the relatively isolated rain forest area ineastern Amazonia and the Guiana Shield. The low diversity on nutrient-poorwhite sand soils in the Amazon basin is not necessarily due to their lownutrient status but is, at least partly, caused by their small extent andfragmented nature.},

	Abstract = {Evaporation and infiltration were compared for tropical rainforest and pasture, near to Manaus, Brazil from October 1990 to February 1992 using measurements of soil water storage over a depth of 2 m. The soil is a clayey oxisol of low water available capacity. In both of the dry seasons studied, the maximum change in soil water storage in the forest was 154 mm and in the pasture it was 131 and 112 mm. Similar behaviour of the soil water reservoir below forest and pasture in the wet season implied that differences in evaporation and drainage were small. In the dry season, soil water storage behaviour in the upper metre of the soil was similar but there were marked differences in the second metre. The pasture took up little water from below 1.5 m but the forest appeared to utilise all of the available water in the 2 m profile in both seasons.

The water balance of the 2 m profile showed that the pasture evaporation rate was equal to that of the forest until storage had decreased 80 mm from the maximum. There was then a decline in pasture evaporation rate to 1.2 mm day−1 as the storage decreased by a further 50 mm. In contrast, the forest uptake rate remained above 3.5 mm day−1 until storage had decreased 140 mm from the maximum (within 15 mm of the extraction limit), before declining abruptly to less than 1.5 mm day−1. There was strong evidence that the forest was able to abstract water from depths greater than 3.6 m.

Spatial variability of soil water storage was significantly greater beneath the pasture than beneath the forest, particularly following rainfall events in the dry season. This was largely the result of redistribution of rainfall as local surface runoff. There was no evidence of redistribution or runoff in the forest.},

@article{nepstad_amazon_2004,
	Abstract = {Severe drought in moist tropical forests provokes large carbon emissions by increasing forest flammability and tree mortality, and by suppressing tree growth. The frequency and severity of drought in the tropics may increase through stronger El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) episodes, global warming, and rainfall inhibition by land use change. However, little is known about the spatial and temporal patterns of drought in moist tropical forests, and the complex relationships between patterns of drought and forest fire regimes, tree mortality, and productivity. We present a simple geographic information system soil water balance model, called RisQue (Risco de Queimada -- Fire Risk) for the Amazon basin that we use to conduct an analysis of these patterns for 1996--2001. RisQue features a map of maximum plant-available soil water (PAWmax) developed using 1565 soil texture profiles and empirical relationships between soil texture and critical soil water parameters. PAW is depleted by monthly evapotranspiration (ET) fields estimated using the Penman--Monteith equation and satellite-derived radiation inputs and recharged by monthly rain fields estimated from 266 meteorological stations. Modeled PAW to 10 m depth (PAW10 m) was similar to field measurements made in two Amazon forests. During the severe drought of 2001, PAW10 m fell to below 25\% of PAWmax in 31\% of the region's forests and fell below 50\% PAWmax in half of the forests. Field measurements and experimental forest fires indicate that soil moisture depletion below 25\% PAWmax corresponds to a reduction in leaf area index of approximately 25\%, increasing forest flammability. Hence, approximately one-third of Amazon forests became susceptible to fire during the 2001 ENSO period. Field measurements also suggest that the ENSO drought of 2001 reduced carbon storage by approximately 0.2 Pg relative to years without severe soil moisture deficits. RisQue is sensitive to spin-up time, rooting depth, and errors in ET estimates. Improvements in our ability to accurately model soil moisture content of Amazon forests will depend upon better understanding of forest rooting depths, which can extend to beyond 15 m. RisQue provides a tool for early detection of forest fire risk.},

@article{maire_global_2015,
	Abstract = {Aim

The influence of soil properties on photosynthetic traits in higher plants is poorly quantified in comparison with that of climate. We address this situation by quantifying the unique and joint contributions to global leaf-trait variation from soils and climate.


Location

Terrestrial ecosystems world-wide.


Methods

Using a trait dataset comprising 1509 species from 288 sites, with climate and soil data derived from global datasets, we quantified the effects of 20 soil and 26 climate variables on light-saturated photosynthetic rate (Aarea), stomatal conductance (gs), leaf nitrogen and phosphorus (Narea and Parea) and specific leaf area (SLA) using mixed regression models and multivariate analyses.


Results

Soil variables were stronger predictors of leaf traits than climatic variables, except for SLA. On average, Narea, Parea and Aarea increased and SLA decreased with increasing soil pH and with increasing site aridity. gs declined and Parea increased with soil available P (Pavail). Narea was unrelated to total soil N. Joint effects of soil and climate dominated over their unique effects on Narea and Parea, while unique effects of soils dominated for Aarea and gs. Path analysis indicated that variation in Aarea reflected the combined independent influences of Narea and gs, the former promoted by high pH and aridity and the latter by low Pavail.


Main conclusions

Three environmental variables were key for explaining variation in leaf traits: soil pH and Pavail, and the climatic moisture index (the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration). Although the reliability of global soil datasets lags behind that of climate datasets, our results nonetheless provide compelling evidence that both can be jointly used in broad-scale analyses, and that effects uniquely attributable to soil properties are important determinants of leaf photosynthetic traits and rates. A significant future challenge is to better disentangle the covarying physiological, ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that underpin trait--environment relationships.},

	Abstract = {* The evolution of lignified xylem allowed for the efficient transport of water under tension, but also exposed the vascular network to the risk of gas emboli and the spread of gas between xylem conduits, thus impeding sap transport to the leaves. A well-known hypothesis proposes that the safety of xylem (its ability to resist embolism formation and spread) should trade off against xylem efficiency (its capacity to transport water).


* We tested this safety--efficiency hypothesis in branch xylem across 335 angiosperm and 89 gymnosperm species. Safety was considered at three levels: the xylem water potentials where 12\%, 50\% and 88\% of maximal conductivity are lost.


* Although correlations between safety and efficiency were weak (r2 {\textless} 0.086), no species had high efficiency and high safety, supporting the idea for a safety--efficiency tradeoff. However, many species had low efficiency and low safety. Species with low efficiency and low safety were weakly associated (r2 {\textless} 0.02 in most cases) with higher wood density, lower leaf- to sapwood-area and shorter stature.


* There appears to be no persuasive explanation for the considerable number of species with both low efficiency and low safety. These species represent a real challenge for understanding the evolution of xylem.},

	Abstract = {Fire is a ubiquitous component of the Earth system that is poorly understood. To date, a global-scale understanding of fire is largely limited to the annual extent of burning as detected by satellites. This is problematic because fire is multidimensional, and focus on a single metric belies its complexity and importance within the Earth system. To address this, we identified five key characteristics of fire regimes---size, frequency, intensity, season, and extent---and combined new and existing global datasets to represent each. We assessed how these global fire regime characteristics are related to patterns of climate, vegetation (biomes), and human activity. Cross-correlations demonstrate that only certain combinations of fire characteristics are possible, reflecting fundamental constraints in the types of fire regimes that can exist. A Bayesian clustering algorithm identified five global syndromes of fire regimes, or pyromes. Four pyromes represent distinctions between crown, litter, and grass-fueled fires, and the relationship of these to biomes and climate are not deterministic. Pyromes were partially discriminated on the basis of available moisture and rainfall seasonality. Human impacts also affected pyromes and are globally apparent as the driver of a fifth and unique pyrome that represents human-engineered modifications to fire characteristics. Differing biomes and climates may be represented within the same pyrome, implying that pathways of change in future fire regimes in response to changes in climate and human activity may be difficult to predict.},

	Abstract = {Leaf seasonality in Amazon forests
Models assume that lower precipitation in tropical forests means less plant-available water and less photosynthesis. Direct measurements in the Amazon, however, show that production remains constant or increases in the dry season. To investigate this mismatch, Wu et al. use tower-based cameras to detect the phenology (i.e., the seasonal patterns) of leaf dynamics in tropical tree crowns in Amazonia, Brazil, and relate this to patterns of CO2 flux. Accounting for age-dependent variation among individual leaves and crowns is necessary for understanding the seasonal dynamics of photosynthesis in the entire ecosystem. Leaf phenology regulates seasonality of the carbon flux in tropical forests across a gradient of climate zones.
Science, this issue p. 972
In evergreen tropical forests, the extent, magnitude, and controls on photosynthetic seasonality are poorly resolved and inadequately represented in Earth system models. Combining camera observations with ecosystem carbon dioxide fluxes at forests across rainfall gradients in Amaz{\^o}nia, we show that aggregate canopy phenology, not seasonality of climate drivers, is the primary cause of photosynthetic seasonality in these forests. Specifically, synchronization of new leaf growth with dry season litterfall shifts canopy composition toward younger, more light-use efficient leaves, explaining large seasonal increases ({\textasciitilde}27\%) in ecosystem photosynthesis. Coordinated leaf development and demography thus reconcile seemingly disparate observations at different scales and indicate that accounting for leaf-level phenology is critical for accurately simulating ecosystem-scale responses to climate change.
Camera recordings of the age distribution of leaves coupled with carbon dioxide flux data show the phenological basis of photosynthesis.

@article{estiarte_few_2016,
	Abstract = {Well defined productivity-precipitation relationships of ecosystems are needed as benchmarks for the validation of land-models used for future projections. The productivity-precipitation relationship may be studied in two ways: the spatial approach relates differences in productivity to those in precipitation among sites along a precipitation gradient (the spatial fit, with a steeper slope); the temporal approach relates inter-annual productivity changes to variation in precipitation within sites (the temporal fits, with flatter slopes). Precipitation-reduction experiments in natural ecosystems represent a complement to the fits, because they can reduce precipitation below the natural range and are thus well suited to study potential effects of climate drying. Here, we analyze the effects of dry treatments in eleven multi-year precipitation-manipulation experiments, focusing on changes in the temporal fit. We expected that structural changes in the dry treatments would occur in some experiments, thereby reducing the intercept of the temporal fit and displacing the productivity-precipitation relationship downward the spatial fit. The majority of experiments (72\%) showed that dry treatments did not alter the temporal fit. This implies that current temporal fits are to be preferred over the spatial fit to benchmark land-model projections of productivity under future climate within the precipitation ranges covered by the experiments. Moreover, in two experiments, the intercept of the temporal fit unexpectedly increased due to mechanisms that reduced either water- or nutrient losses. The expected decrease of the intercept was observed in only one experiment, and only when distinguishing between the late and the early phases of the experiment. This implies that we currently do not know at which precipitation-reduction level or at which experimental duration structural changes will start to alter ecosystem productivity. Our study highlights the need for experiments with multiple, including more extreme, dry treatments, to identify the precipitation boundaries within which the current temporal fits remain valid.

Although encroaching forests can sequester carbon over the short term, increased fires and drought-fire interactions could offset carbon gains, which may be amplified by the shift toward forest plant communities more susceptible to fire-driven dieback. We quantify how bark thickness determines the ability of individual tree species to tolerate fire and subsequently determine the fire sensitivity of ecosystem carbon across 180 plots in savannas and forests throughout the 2.2-million km2 Cerrado region in Brazil. We find that not accounting for variation in bark thickness across tree species underestimated carbon losses in forests by {\textasciitilde}50\%, totaling 0.22 PgC across the Cerrado region. The lower bark thicknesses of plant species in forests decreased fire tolerance to such an extent that a third of carbon gains during forest encroachment may be at risk of dieback if burned. These results illustrate that consideration of trait-based differences in fire tolerance is critical for determining the climate-carbon-fire feedback in tropical savanna and forest biomes.},

By analysing worldwide variation in six major traits critical to growth, survival and reproduction within the largest sample of vascular plant species ever compiled, we found that occupancy of six-dimensional trait space is strongly concentrated, indicating coordination and trade-offs. Three-quarters of trait variation is captured in a two-dimensional global spectrum of plant form and function. One major dimension within this plane reflects the size of whole plants and their parts; the other represents the leaf economics spectrum, which balances leaf construction costs against growth potential. The global plant trait spectrum provides a backdrop for elucidating constraints on evolution, for functionally qualifying species and ecosystems, and for improving models that predict future vegetation based on continuous variation in plant form and function.},

@article{lopez-bucio_role_2003,
	Abstract = {The ability of plants to respond appropriately to nutrient availability is of fundamental importance for their adaptation to the environment. Nutrients such as nitrate, phosphate, sulfate and iron act as signals that can be perceived. These signals trigger molecular mechanisms that modify cell division and cell differentiation processes within the root and have a profound impact on root system architecture. Important developmental processes, such as root-hair formation, primary root growth and lateral root formation, are particularly sensitive to changes in the internal and external concentration of nutrients. The responses of root architecture to nutrients can be modified by plant growth regulators, such as auxins, cytokinins and ethylene, suggesting that the nutritional control of root development may be mediated by changes in hormone synthesis, transport or sensitivity. Recent information points to the existence of nutrient-specific signal transduction pathways that interpret the external and internal concentrations of nutrients to modify root development. Progress in this field has led to the cloning of regulatory genes that play pivotal roles in nutrient-induced changes to root development.},

	Abstract = {The nature of an ecosystem is determined first of all by abiotic factors---climate and soil, and secondly by biotic factors---vegetation and fauna. It is therefore mistaken, when proposing ecological subdivisions, to take into account only one of these factors, as is common practice when maps of climate, soil conditions or vegetation are drawn. On the other hand, it is impossible to consider all these factors at the same time. In a stepwise process of subdivision into ever smaller units, consideration must be given to the priority to be accorded to each factor. The first decision to be made is which of these four factors should form the basis on which to establish the first major subdivisions.},

	Abstract = {Photosynthesis by autotrophic green plants---the producers---is the essential prerequisite for all life on earth and initiates the material cycle and energy flow within every ecosystem. In this process, atmospheric CO2 is taken up by the chloroplasts and, with the aid of absorbed light energy, is converted to organic compounds, mostly carbohydrates; during this process storage of chemical energy takes place. Intermediate compounds with three carbon atoms may be formed; this is therefore known as C3-photosynthesis. In C3 plants fixation of CO2 and absorption of the light necessary for the synthesis take place in the same chloroplast. It has been found that the situation is different in some tropical plants in which CO2 fixation takes place in the chloroplasts of the mesophyll, with the formation of malate as an intermediate product.},

Only at the absolute limits of distribution, in arid and icy deserts, at the edge of the salt desert or where the forest shade is deepest---in other words, where competition is absent---do environmental factors (usually one extreme factor) have a direct effect on plant distribution. Apart from these exceptional cases and the pioneer plants on soil that is otherwise devoid of vegetation, all plants in natural conditions are in competition with each other.

It is necessary, therefore, to discuss briefly certain aspects of this history, but mentioning only those features which contribute to an under-standing of the geobiosphere of today.

	Abstract = {Many species are very widely distributed and grow under apparently very different climatic conditions. Waterplants have, to some extent, a very cosmopolitan distribution, but this is due to the fact that all over the world they find habitats where very similar conditions prevail. An example of this is the rigid hornwort, Ceratophyllum demersum, which grows not only in tropical waters but also in those of zones with a cold winter. In the latter, this plant forms dormant winter buds (turions) and overwinters at the bottom of the lake or pond. Annual weeds require only a short period for their development in biotopes where there is no competition; these may be fields in arid areas with a short rainy period, or in those areas in temperate zones which have short, hot summers or, frequently, uncultivated soils in warm climates.},

When accurate data are available, this mean value is recorded on the climatic diagram, left of the temperature curve; the absolute maximum and the mean daily maximum of the warmest month are also recorded (above on the ordinate), as are the average daily minimum of the coldest month and the absolute minimum (below on the ordinate). Absolute fluctuations in temperature at the equator can, even at sea level, be 13--18$\,^{\circ}$C. This can easily be overlooked, if the monthly average alone is taken into account.

	Abstract = {The producers of zonobiome I are the plants of the evergreen tropical rain-forest, which has developed in the course of the earth's history from the earliest terrestrial plant communities. We pointed out in Vol. I that it was probably in the climatic zone of the humid tropics that the first cormophytes, the psilophytes, established themselves on land. The pteridophyte forests of the Lower-Carboniferous were also probably limited to this climatic zone. Subsequently, they were gradually replaced by gymnosperms until finally, in the Tertiary, angiosperm tree species became completely dominant. Evidence for this view of the course of evolution is that extant relicts of the oldest pteridophytes are found only or mainly in tropical rain-forests. These are Psilotum, with very small scalelike leaves on rodlike shoots, and Tmesipteris with larger leaves, which, however, are vertically inserted. These two species are the nearest relatives of the now extinct psilophytes.},

	Abstract = {In the past, the tropical rain-forests covered extensive areas. Today, however, uninterrupted stretches of rain-forest are found only in relatively inaccessible places. Even those remaining have recently been endangered by large-scale clearance and by road construction, as in the Amazonian rain-forest area (Kohlhepp 1976). By 1963 no less than 10 million ha of this forest had been destroyed, as well as a further 8.6 million ha in Asia. It has been estimated that of the original 218 million ha of equatorial rain-forest in Africa, about 165 million were destroyed in the 2 decades between 1965 and 1985. In south-east Asia the figure could be as great as 225 million ha (Lamprecht 1973). Even the lowland rain-forests of Papua-New Guinea are now seriously threatened (Webb 1977).},

Many peaks here are higher than 5000 m NN. In Costa Rica the highest peak is 4000 m NN. The tepuis in Guayana rise to less than 3000 m NN and have such steep sides that an altitudinal belt series cannot develop. Vegetation is in fact found only on the flat upper surface of the tepuis, growing on poor quartzite-sandstone soils; it has only recently been investigated. Ecologically, the tepuis must be regarded as peinobiomes (see Vol. I, p. 219). Ecological investigations have been made of the alpine ``p{\'a}ramo'' belt in the Venezuelan Andes near Merida.},

These always fall where the sun is precisely at the zenith at midday. Thus, the rainfall belt shifts with the position of the sun --- during the northern summer, as far as the northern tropic; during the southern summer, as far as the southern tropic: this is shown diagrammatically in Fig. 1.71. In the course of a year, the two zenith positions of the sun lie ever closer together with increasing distance from the equator (Fig. 1.72).},

@incollection{walter_soil_1986,
	Abstract = {It has already been mentioned under ZB I that the sesquioxides (A12O3, Fe2O3), charac- teristic of tropical soils, are readily movable in wet soil, but become stone hard when the soil dries out, forming lateritic crusts or ``hardpan'' (ZB I, p. 18). In the perhumid climate of ZB I this seldom occurs, but is frequently the case in the humid-arid climate of ZB II. Zonobiome I is mainly limited to the large equatorial basins, whereas in Africa south of the equator the area covered by ZB II is mostly highland plateau, including the old Gondwanaland and those areas more recently leveled as a result of denudation. During the rainy season, the soils of these flat areas are heavily wetted, but during the long drought period they dry out to great depths. There are correspondingly marked fluctuations in the groundwater table, and this favours the formation of lateritic crusts. Such hardpan acts as a barrier preventing water from seeping into the deeper soil layers, thus altering the water balance in the soil: in some cases a bog may form; in others, as a result of lateral seepage above the crust, there may be a reduction in the amount of water retained by the soil; in either case the development of the vegetation is radically affected.},

@incollection{walter_decomposers_1986-1,
	Abstract = {The litter which every year falls to the ground is decomposed by microflora, by soil fauna, such as termites and by fire. No detailed information is available about the microflora of zonobiome II. Termites can be divided, on the basis of their feeding habits, into three groups: soil-eating, wood-eating and mixed feeders. The first group feeds on decomposing organic matter mixed with mineral soil particles; their faeces form the basis of stable humus. This group of termites is the most common: in a miombo forest, for instance, they form 50\% of the termite population. The total biomass of all termites reaches 21.8 kg ha-1 in dry weight. The second group attacks dead wood, while the third collects whole, dead plant parts, including grasses; both establish underground fungal gardens in their nests. Termites are active almost throughout the year, but not during the driest part of the dry season. During the drought period, fire is the most effective factor causing decomposition by destroying the dry grasses. The microflora are active mainly during the humid season, for only at this time is the hydrature of these poikilohydric microbes sufficiently high.},

The effect of the dry season is usually also lessened by lower temperatures and longer periods of cloud cover, so that in the montane belt the rain-green forests of the lowlands are replaced by evergreen forests resembling those of orobiome I.},

	Abstract = {Kazakhstan is a political unit encompassing a very extensive area. It stretches from 55.5$\,^{\circ}$N to 41$\,^{\circ}$N (1500km) and from 46.5$\,^{\circ}$E to 87.3$\,^{\circ}$E (3000km), covering a total of 2.7 million km2 (Fig. 4.1). The western part of Kasakhstan, which forms part of the Caspian Depression, and the northern region, which is a continuation southwards of the Siberian steppe zone, are not dealt with in this section. The former has been considered in Part 3 of this volume, while the latter, the steppe zone, was settled and turned into farmland as part of a large-scale agricultural scheme before any ecological investigation had been made of the area. After several years of good rainfall, yields were satisfactory; these were followed, however, by a long period of drought when harvests failed completely, showing that agriculture is an unprofitable undertaking in this region.},

	Abstract = {Compared with the subtropical deserts of zonobiome III, conditions in these middle-Asian deserts, with no greater rainfall, are less extreme. For the vegetation this is partly because after a process of hardening, the plants enter a period of quiescence, and water losses through winter dryness are minimal. Furthermore, precipitation in winter accumulates as snow, so that in spring water from the thaw can seep deeply into the soil and is stored there. Apart from the Mohave desert in North America and the Andean desert of South America, which have been described in Vol. 2, this type of desert is found only in Asia, where it covers a vast area (Fig. 5.1).},

	Abstract = {Laterite Soil Engineering is one of a few books about solving engineering problems with the help of engineering pedology. This book presents the latest information on the laterite soils' geotechnical characteristics and engineering behavior. It shows that laterite soils are different from natural soils and that most laterite soils can be evaluated for engineering purposes using accepted theories and well-known test procedures for temperate-zone soils. This book also shows that modern concepts based on pedological considerations are very useful and take a logical approach to the identification and evaluation of laterite soils for engineering purposes. The first four chapters focus on reviewing information about the processes of tropical weathering and laterization. Chapter five summarizes information about the location, morphology and composition of laterite soils. Chapter six highlights the geotechnical implications of the pedogenic processes of tropical weathering, and it emphasizes the contribution of the results of these pedogenic processes to the deviations of engineering behavior of the problem of laterite soils. In addition, chapter seven discusses the influence of laterite soil genesis on the physic-chemical characteristics based on comparing the properties of three genetic soil groups formed under three different weathering conditions. Chapters eight through nineteen discuss the geotechnical characteristics and evaluation of laterite soils, and the effects of pedogenesis and soil-forming factors on the geotechnical and stabilization characteristics of laterite soils. The last chapter discusses the little information that exists on the application of laterite soils in engineering problems.},

	Abstract = {The degree of isolation following the break-up of the Gondwanan super continent has been a major influence contributing to the uniqueness of the Australian flora. This uniqueness does not hold for community structural development; Australian savannas are broadly similar to those on other southern continents but they diverge at finer levels of structure. At a broad scale the composition and structure of the savannas are related to climatic and soil variables which have generated a wide range of savanna types. The soils are generally low in nutrients being derived from an extensively preserved and deeply weathered Tertiary mantle. The frequent and large-scale fires and, until the early 1800s, the low level of herbivore intervention and use by man have been formative. Savanna lands are widespread and cover approximately 53\% or 4,1 × 106 km2 of the Australian continent. Over the past 180 years the less xeric savannas have been developed for grazing by domestic livestock through tree clearing and pasture seeding.},

@incollection{eiten_brazilian_1982,
	Abstract = {The term ``savanna'' is used by botanists and geographers in many senses. These, however, all fall into two groups: that in which the word is used for a particular physiognomy, for any kind of vegetation, and that in which the word is used for a particular kind of vegetation, that is, a vegetation type. In the latter case, not only physiognomy but also floristic composition and habitat factors enter into the definition. Authors who use ``savanna'' for a vegetation type usually use it only for certain types intermediate between evergreen forest and desert in tropical or tropical-subtropical regions, not in temperate or polar regions. Thus, in South America there are the Llanos, the Gran Sabana, the northern and southern Guiana savannas, the Gran Panjonal, and the Amazonian campos and savannas such as the Campos do Rio Branco in Roraima Territory, Campos do Humaita in south-east Amazonas, and others in Amapa, Marajo Island, Monte Alegre, Alenquer, etc, as well as thousands of smaller ones scattered over the Amazon-Orinoco forest region. The open forms of the Amazon ``caatingas'' (currently called ``campinas'' by some authors), concentrated in the Rio Negro drainage, are also savannas in this wide sense. The large region of central Brazil cerrado and, according to some authors (Cole 1960), the north-east Brazil caatinga are also ``savanna''.},

Through the chaco this diagonal of open formations affords access and transconnection of xeric areas from the west, north-west and south (Monte Desert, Andean shrub formations and Patagonian Desert, Figure 1).},

	Abstract = {Within subtropical latitudes the savannas comprise five major categories of vegetation, namely woodlands, parklands, grasslands, low tree and shrub communities and scrub (Cole 1963b). In some areas, notably in Brazil, gradations between those categories occur and in all areas variation in the form and composition of the vegetation occurs within each one. These variations have promoted diverse and complex classifications of the vegetation which, in most cases, have been elaborated for particular continents or regions (Aubreville 1949; Gillman 1949). The additional units recognized in these classifications, however, represent variants induced by local environmental conditions and can be accommodated within the simple classification outlined above.},

This contrast is epitomized by the abrupt transition in north central Tanzania from the grasslands of the Serengeti region to the Brachystegia woodlands of western Tanzania. This paper has grown out of an attempt to account for this contrast.},

	Abstract = {The savannas of Africa are occupied by the earth's richest and most spectacular large mammal fauna. This fauna was even richer in the distant past and it is reasonable to expect that these large animals have long influenced the plants on which they prey and through them the form of the savannas. This long evolutionary history, the recent widespread disturbance by man and his livestock and the persistence of savannas on other continents without a similar large mammal fauna make it difficult to determine unequivocally the degree to which large wild herbivores have influenced the structure of the African savannas. There is much observational information but, apart from that on grazing systems for livestock, there is little experimentally supported evidence on the effects of large herbivores on savanna structure. The degree to which large herbivore influence is recognized rests largely on the scale and perspective with which one examines the savannas. On a continental scale large herbivore effects pale into insignificance beside that of say climate, but within a particular ecosystem the large herbivores may function as a determinant of savanna structure just as surely as fire, or frost, or man.},

In this paper Australian tropical savannas are defined as communities in which the grass component is often predominant but in which predominance may vary between grassy and woody components. The grassy-woody status is determined not only by static landscape factors, but also by the dynamic interactions of fire-grazing intensities and by fluctuations in climate, particularly rainfall. The tropical savannas are well represented north of the tropic of Capricorn but, particularly in eastern Australia, may have significant continuous southward extensions. The hummock and tussock grasslands which occupy large areas of the essentially desert interior of Australia are not considered in this chapter.},

@incollection{medina_physiological_1982,
	Abstract = {Savanna is a distinctive vegetation type found within the tropical climate belt and is characterized by a continuous cover of mainly C4 perennial grasses with or without scattered trees, or these forming a semi-closed canopy with grasses underneath. They constitute a long-standing phytogeographical problem, since they occupy the same climatic regions as the tropical deciduous forest. Explanations for the existence of grass dominated landscapes where deciduous forest is to be expected differ markedly. Savannas in the tropics have been considered to be determined by a special savanna climate, by edaphic conditions, by fire or by man-made influences. There is apparently now enough evidence to consider savannas as a natural vegetation type whose range has changed at least during and since the pleistocene, mainly due to variations in rainfall patterns (Beard 1953; Hueck 1957; Sarmiento and Monasterio 1975; Walter 1973).},

@incollection{tainton_response_1982,
	Abstract = {The perennial grasslands of South Africa are inherently extremely mixed but in the subtropical and tropical regions they are characteristically dominated by a relatively small number of species. Hence, the Southern Tall Grassveld of Natal (Veld Type No 64, Acocks 1953) has a species list comprising no fewer than 512 species but in good samples of such veld Themeda triandra (49\%) and Apochaete hispida (23\%) account for about three-quarters of the veld cover (Foran et al l978). Even in degenerate veld where these species may be relatively unimportant or absent, the veld still tends to be dominated by a relatively small number of species. The Eragrostis and Sporobolus genera often dominate overgrazed areas, Apochaete, Cymbopogon and some species of Hyparrhenia dominate under-utilized areas, and Aristida junciformis may dominate with excessive selective grazing and with complete protection from any form of canopy removal (Foran et al 1978). Hence, in spite of the large number of species which occur in this veld, an understanding of growth responses of a relatively small number of species should definitely assist in the interpretation of the response of the veld as a whole to management. Above all, an understanding of the morphology of development of the tillers of such plants is crucial to an understanding of normal patterns of plant development and to an understanding of the influence of various forms of defoliation on these plants.},

@article{franco_cerrado_2014,
	Abstract = {The cerrado is the most extensive savanna ecosystem of South America and a biodiversity hotspot, harboring a diverse flora ({\textgreater}7,000 species) with high levels of endemism. More than 50 \% of the cerrado's approximately 2 million km2 has been converted into pasture and agricultural lands and it is uncertain how the remaining areas will respond to increasing pressures from land use and climate change. Interactions between disturbance regime and resource (water and nutrient) availability are known to determine the distribution of the various plant communities, of contrasting structure and composition, which coexist in the region. We discuss how fire, nutrients and species traits regulate plant community responses to rising CO2 and global warming, exploring constraints to forest expansion into savanna environments. We describe how climate change will likely reverse a natural process of forest expansion, observed in the region over the past few millennia, accelerating tree cover loss through feedbacks involving fire and resource limitation, and counteracting expected CO2 stimulation effects. These involve changes in fundamental processes occurring above and below ground, which will probably also impact species performance, distribution and biodiversity patterns. We propose a conceptual framework for predicting changes on vegetation structure, highlighting the need for mechanistic models to accurately simulate vegetation dynamics under climate change scenarios.

	Abstract = {We present the greenhouse gas concentrations for the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and their extensions beyond 2100, the Extended Concentration Pathways (ECPs). These projections include all major anthropogenic greenhouse gases and are a result of a multi-year effort to produce new scenarios for climate change research. We combine a suite of atmospheric concentration observations and emissions estimates for greenhouse gases (GHGs) through the historical period (1750--2005) with harmonized emissions projected by four different Integrated Assessment Models for 2005--2100. As concentrations are somewhat dependent on the future climate itself (due to climate feedbacks in the carbon and other gas cycles), we emulate median response characteristics of models assessed in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report using the reduced-complexity carbon cycle climate model MAGICC6. Projected `best-estimate' global-mean surface temperature increases (using inter alia a climate sensitivity of 3$\,^{\circ}$C) range from 1.5$\,^{\circ}$C by 2100 for the lowest of the four RCPs, called both RCP3-PD and RCP2.6, to 4.5$\,^{\circ}$C for the highest one, RCP8.5, relative to pre-industrial levels. Beyond 2100, we present the ECPs that are simple extensions of the RCPs, based on the assumption of either smoothly stabilizing concentrations or constant emissions: For example, the lower RCP2.6 pathway represents a strong mitigation scenario and is extended by assuming constant emissions after 2100 (including net negative CO2 emissions), leading to CO2 concentrations returning to 360 ppm by 2300. We also present the GHG concentrations for one supplementary extension, which illustrates the stringent emissions implications of attempting to go back to ECP4.5 concentration levels by 2250 after emissions during the 21st century followed the higher RCP6 scenario. Corresponding radiative forcing values are presented for the RCP and ECPs.},

	Abstract = {Keep Your Distance
Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD), whereby the abundance of a species is limited by negative interactions between individuals of the same species, is thought to have an important influence on the composition and dynamics of forest communities, but studies have generally been limited to few species and small areas. Johnson et al. (p. 904) analyzed CNDD in over 200,000 plots from a database of more than 3 million individuals of 151 species spanning 4 million square kilometers across forests in the eastern United States and found that the strength of CNDD strongly predicted the relative abundance of tree species. Because tree seedlings are unlikely to become established where conspecific adults are common, CNDD may provide a general mechanism maintaining diversity in forests.
Conspecific negative density-dependent establishment, in which local abundance negatively affects establishment of conspecific seedlings through host-specific enemies, can influence species diversity of plant communities, but the generality of this process is not well understood. We tested the strength of density dependence using the United States Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis database containing 151 species from more than 200,000 forest plots spanning 4,000,000 square kilometers. We found that most species experienced conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD), but there was little effect of heterospecific density. Additionally, abundant species exhibited weaker CNDD than rarer species, and species-rich regions exhibited stronger CNDD than species-poor regions. Collectively, our results provide evidence that CNDD is a pervasive mechanism driving diversity across a gradient from boreal to subtropical forests.
Tree seedlings have a harder time establishing themselves in forests containing many adults of the same species.

@article{muelbert_seasonal_2016,
	Abstract = {Within the tropics, the species richness of tree communities is strongly and positively associated with precipitation. Previous research has suggested that this macroecological pattern is driven by the negative effect of water-stress on the physiological processes of most tree species. This process implies that the range limits of taxa are defined by their ability to occur under dry conditions, and thus in terms of species distributions it predicts a nested pattern of taxa distribution from wet to dry areas. However, this `dry-tolerance' hypothesis has yet to be adequately tested at large spatial and taxonomic scales. Here, using a dataset of 531 inventory plots of closed canopy forest distributed across the Western Neotropics we investigated how precipitation, evaluated both as mean annual precipitation and as the maximum climatological water deficit, influences the distribution of tropical tree species, genera and families. We find that the distributions of tree taxa are indeed nested along precipitation gradients in the western Neotropics. Taxa tolerant to seasonal drought are disproportionally widespread across the precipitation gradient, with most reaching even the wettest climates sampled; however, most taxa analysed are restricted to wet areas. Our results suggest that the `dry tolerance' hypothesis has broad applicability in the world's most species-rich forests. In addition, the large number of species restricted to wetter conditions strongly indicates that an increased frequency of drought could severely threaten biodiversity in this region. Overall, this study establishes a baseline for exploring how tropical forest tree composition may change in response to current and future environmental changes in this region.

@article{noilhan_gcm_1995,
	Abstract = {This paper investigates the problem of aggregation of land surface properties in a large area comparable in size with a model grid box of a GCM. The study is based on 3D numerical results obtained for atmospheric situations encountered during HAPEX-MOBILHY 1986-that is, moderate plant water stress at the beginning of summer. Estimating effective surface properties describing the spatial distribution of the vegetation and the soil texture within the large area under study is proposed as a first guess for accounting for spatial variability. Despite the nonlinear dependence of surface fluxes on both vegetation and soil water content, it is found that the effective surface fluxes computed from effective parameters with a ID column model match the areal-averaged fluxes estimated from 3D mesoscale model results with a relative error less than 10\%. On the other hand, fluxes computed with prescribed surface properties associated with the dominant land use of the large domain depart significantly from the averaged fluxes. For the cases examined, the effects of nonlinearity are found to be smaller for the vegetation behavior than for the soil water transfers. The parameter aggregation method has been tested successfully for a long lime period within the context of a ID GCM grid cell representing the HAPEX-MOBILHY 1986 instrumented area. Given precipitation and solar radiation fluxes, predictions of soil water content and total evaporation for 25 days compare well with aggregated observations within the large area.},

It is a intermediate step leading up to the next phase of the Global Soil Wetness Project (GSWP) (Phase 2), for which there will be a broader investigation of the aggregation between global scales (GSWP-1) and the river scale. This project makes use of the Rh{\^o}ne modeling system, which was developed in recent years by the French research community in order to study the continental water cycle on a regional scale. The main goals of this study are to investigate how 15 LSSs simulate the water balance for several annual cycles compared to data from a dense observation network consisting of daily discharge from over 145 gauges and daily snow depth from 24 sites, and to examine the impact of changing the spatial scale on the simulations. The overall evapotranspiration, runoff, and monthly change in water storage are similarly simulated by the LSSs, however, the differing partitioning among the fluxes results in very different river discharges and soil moisture equilibrium states. Subgrid runoff is especially important for discharge at the daily timescale and for smaller-scale basins. Also, models using an explicit treatment of the snowpack compared better with the observations than simpler composite schemes. Results from a series of scaling experiments are examined for which the spatial resolution of the computational grid is decreased to be consistent with large-scale atmospheric models. The impact of upscaling on the domain-averaged hydrological components is similar among most LSSs, with increased evaporation of water intercepted by the canopy and a decrease in surface runoff representing the most consistent inter-LSS responses. A significant finding is that the snow water equivalent is greatly reduced by upscaling in all LSSs but one that explicitly accounts for subgrid-scale orography effects on the atmospheric forcing.},

Abstract
As ecological data are usually analysed at a scale different from the one at which the process of interest operates, interpretations can be confusing and controversial. For example, hypothesised differences between species do not operate at the species level, but concern individuals responding to environmental variation, including competition with neighbours. Aggregated data from many individuals subject to spatio-temporal variation are used to produce species-level averages, which marginalise away the relevant (process-level) scale. Paradoxically, the higher the dimensionality, the more ways there are to differ, yet the more species appear the same. The aggregate becomes increasingly irrelevant and misleading. Standard analyses can make species look the same, reverse species rankings along niche axes, make the surprising prediction that a species decreases in abundance when a competitor is removed from a model, or simply preclude parameter estimation. Aggregation explains why niche differences hidden at the species level become apparent upon disaggregation to the individual level, why models suggest that individual-level variation has a minor impact on diversity when disaggregation shows it to be important, and why literature-based synthesis can be unfruitful.

@article{pearson_germination_2002,
	Abstract = {Germination provides many potentially unrecognized sources of variation in the regeneration niche. In this study we relate germination requirements and seed size for 16 species of pioneer trees to microclimatic conditions present in gaps in semi-deciduous rain forest in Panama. We found that, whereas increased duration of direct irradiance can be an effective indicator of the presence of a canopy gap across all scales of canopy openness, diel fluctuations in soil temperature effectively discriminate both understory sites and small gaps (25 m2) from larger gaps. Germination response was significantly related to seed size. Small-seeded species (seed mass {\textless}2 mg) showed significantly greater germination in response to irradiance of 22.3 μmol·m−2·s−1 than in complete darkness. Their germination was unaffected by an increasing magnitude of diel temperature fluctuation up to a species-specific threshold, above which it declined. Large-seeded species (seed mass {\textgreater}2 mg) germinated equally in light and darkness (with one exception) and either showed a positive germination response to an increasing magnitude of temperature fluctuation (four species) or no significant response (four species). The maximum seed burial depth from which seedlings could emerge successfully was strongly positively associated with seed mass. We conclude that photoblastic germination of tropical pioneer trees results in small-seeded species germinating in gaps only when seeds are located in microsites that are suitable for seedling emergence. A positive germination response to increasing temperature fluctuation can stimulate germination of larger-seeded species in larger gaps and when they are buried beneath an opaque soil or litter layer. Therefore, seed size differences constrain the physiological mechanisms of canopy gap detection in tropical pioneer trees and might contribute to observed differences in the distribution of adult plants in relation to canopy gap size.},

	Abstract = {A large number of newly published and unpublished hectare plots in Amazonia and the Guiana Shield area allow an analysis of family composition and testing of hypotheses concerning alpha-diversity in the south American rain forest. Using data from 94 plots the family-level floristic patterns in wet tropical South America are described. To test diversity patterns, 268 plots are used in this large area. Contrary to a widely held belief, western Amazonian plots are not necessarily the most diverse. Several central Amazonian plots have equal or even higher tree diversity. Annual rainfall is not a good estimator for tree diversity in the Amazonia area and Guiana shield. Plots in the Guiana Shield area (and eastern Amazonia) usually have lower diversity than those in central or western Amazonia. It is argued that this is not because of low rainfall or low nutrient status of the soil but because of the small area of the relatively isolated rain forest area in eastern Amazonia and the Guiana Shield. The low diversity on nutrient-poor white sand soils in the Amazon basin is not necessarily due to their low nutrient status but is, at least partly, caused by their small extent and fragmented nature.},

	Abstract = {The terrestrial carbon sink has been large in recent decades, but its size and location remain uncertain. Using forest inventory data and long-term ecosystem carbon studies, we estimate a total forest sink of 2.4 $\pm$ 0.4 petagrams of carbon per year (Pg C year--1) globally for 1990 to 2007. We also estimate a source of 1.3 $\pm$ 0.7 Pg C year--1 from tropical land-use change, consisting of a gross tropical deforestation emission of 2.9 $\pm$ 0.5 Pg C year--1 partially compensated by a carbon sink in tropical forest regrowth of 1.6 $\pm$ 0.5 Pg C year--1. Together, the fluxes comprise a net global forest sink of 1.1 $\pm$ 0.8 Pg C year--1, with tropical estimates having the largest uncertainties. Our total forest sink estimate is equivalent in magnitude to the terrestrial sink deduced from fossil fuel emissions and land-use change sources minus ocean and atmospheric sinks.
Net average global annual uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide by forests was 1.1 petagrams of carbon, roughly one-sixth of fossil fuel emissions.

@article{baccini_estimated_2012,
	Abstract = {Deforestation contributes 6--17\% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. Large uncertainties in emission estimates arise from inadequate data on the carbon density of forests and the regional rates of deforestation. Consequently there is an urgent need for improved data sets that characterize the global distribution of aboveground biomass, especially in the tropics. Here we use multi-sensor satellite data to estimate aboveground live woody vegetation carbon density for pan-tropical ecosystems with unprecedented accuracy and spatial resolution. Results indicate that the total amount of carbon held in tropical woody vegetation is 228.7 Pg C, which is 21\% higher than the amount reported in the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2010 (ref. 3). At the national level, Brazil and Indonesia contain 35\% of the total carbon stored in tropical forests and produce the largest emissions from forest loss. Combining estimates of aboveground carbon stocks with regional deforestation rates we estimate the total net emission of carbon from tropical deforestation and land use to be 1.0 Pg C yr−1 over the period 2000--2010---based on the carbon bookkeeping model. These new data sets of aboveground carbon stocks will enable tropical nations to meet their emissions reporting requirements (that is, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Tier 3) with greater accuracy.},

@article{oliveras_many_2016,
	Abstract = {The forest--savannah transition is the most widespread ecotone in tropical areas, separating two of the most productive terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we review current understanding of the factors that shape this transition, and how it may change under various drivers of local or global change. At broadest scales, the location of the transition is shaped by water availability, mediated strongly at local scales by fire regimes, herbivory pressure and spatial variation in soil properties. The frequently dynamic nature of this transition suggests that forest and savannah can exist as alternative stable states, maintained and separated by fire--grass feedbacks and tree shade--fire suppression feedback. However, this theory is still contested and the relative contributions of the main biotic and abiotic drivers and their interactions are yet not fully understood. These drivers interplay with a wide range of ecological processes and attributes at the global, continental, regional and local scales. The evolutionary history of the biotic and abiotic drivers and processes plays an important role in the current distributions of these transitions as well as in their species composition and ecosystem functioning. This ecotone can be sensitive to shifts in climate and other driving factors, but is also potentially stabilized by negative feedback processes. There is abundant evidence that these transitions are shifting under contemporary global and local changes, but the direction of shift varies according to region. However, it still remains uncertain how these transitions will respond to rapid and multi-faceted ongoing current changes, and how increasing human influence will interact with these shifts.

@article{johnson_variation_2016,
	Abstract = {Understanding the processes that determine above-ground biomass (AGB) in Amazonian forests is important for predicting the sensitivity of these ecosystems to environmental change and for designing and evaluating dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs). AGB is determined by inputs from woody productivity [woody net primary productivity (NPP)] and the rate at which carbon is lost through tree mortality. Here, we test whether two direct metrics of tree mortality (the absolute rate of woody biomass loss and the rate of stem mortality) and/or woody NPP, control variation in AGB among 167 plots in intact forest across Amazonia. We then compare these relationships and the observed variation in AGB and woody NPP with the predictions of four DGVMs. The observations show that stem mortality rates, rather than absolute rates of woody biomass loss, are the most important predictor of AGB, which is consistent with the importance of stand size structure for determining spatial variation in AGB. The relationship between stem mortality rates and AGB varies among different regions of Amazonia, indicating that variation in wood density and height/diameter relationships also influences AGB. In contrast to previous findings, we find that woody NPP is not correlated with stem mortality rates and is weakly positively correlated with AGB. Across the four models, basin-wide average AGB is similar to the mean of the observations. However, the models consistently overestimate woody NPP and poorly represent the spatial patterns of both AGB and woody NPP estimated using plot data. In marked contrast to the observations, DGVMs typically show strong positive relationships between woody NPP and AGB. Resolving these differences will require incorporating forest size structure, mechanistic models of stem mortality and variation in functional composition in DGVMs.},

	Abstract = {The world's forests influence climate through physical, chemical, and biological processes that affect planetary energetics, the hydrologic cycle, and atmospheric composition. These complex and nonlinear forest-atmosphere interactions can dampen or amplify anthropogenic climate change. Tropical, temperate, and boreal reforestation and afforestation attenuate global warming through carbon sequestration. Biogeophysical feedbacks can enhance or diminish this negative climate forcing. Tropical forests mitigate warming through evaporative cooling, but the low albedo of boreal forests is a positive climate forcing. The evaporative effect of temperate forests is unclear. The net climate forcing from these and other processes is not known. Forests are under tremendous pressure from global change. Interdisciplinary science that integrates knowledge of the many interacting climate services of forests with the impacts of global change is necessary to identify and understand as yet unexplored feedbacks in the Earth system and the potential of forests to mitigate climate change.},

@article{kolby_smith_large_2016,
	Abstract = {Atmospheric mass balance analyses suggest that terrestrial carbon (C) storage is increasing, partially abating the atmospheric [CO2] growth rate, although the continued strength of this important ecosystem service remains uncertain. Some evidence suggests that these increases will persist owing to positive responses of vegetation growth (net primary productivity; NPP) to rising atmospheric [CO2] (that is, `CO2 fertilization'). Here, we present a new satellite-derived global terrestrial NPP data set, which shows a significant increase in NPP from 1982 to 2011. However, comparison against Earth system model (ESM) NPP estimates reveals a significant divergence, with satellite-derived increases (2.8 $\pm$ 1.50\%) less than half of ESM-derived increases (7.6 $\pm$ 1.67\%) over the 30-year period. By isolating the CO2 fertilization effect in each NPP time series and comparing it against a synthesis of available free-air CO2 enrichment data, we provide evidence that much of the discrepancy may be due to an over-sensitivity of ESMs to atmospheric [CO2], potentially reflecting an under-representation of climatic feedbacks and/or a lack of representation of nutrient constraints. Our understanding of CO2 fertilization effects on NPP needs rapid improvement to enable more accurate projections of future C cycle--climate feedbacks; we contend that better integration of modelling, satellite and experimental approaches offers a promising way forward.},

Current knowledge of long-term changes in vegetation activity is regional, or restricted to highly integrated measures of change such as net primary productivity, which mask details that are relevant for Earth system dynamics. Such details can be revealed by measuring changes in the phenology of vegetation activity. Here we undertake a comprehensive global assessment of changes in vegetation phenology. We show that the phenology of vegetation activity changed severely (by more than 2 standard deviations in one or more dimensions of phenological change) on 54\% of the global land surface between 1981 and 2012. Our analysis confirms previously detected changes in the boreal and northern temperate regions. The adverse consequences of these northern phenological shifts for land-surface--climate feedbacks, ecosystems and species are well known. Our study reveals equally severe phenological changes in the southern hemisphere, where consequences for the energy budget and the likelihood of phenological mismatches are unknown. Our analysis provides a sensitive and direct measurement of ecosystem functioning, making it useful both for monitoring change and for testing the reliability of early warning signals of change.},

@article{buitenwerf_convergence_2016,
	Abstract = {Aim

The seasonal timing and duration of leaf deployment has major implications for earth--atmosphere interactions and biotic processes. While evidence for impacts of global change on the timing of leaf deployment (leaf phenology) is accumulating, knowledge of the mechanisms that determine the duration of leaf deployment (leaf habit) and its geographical distribution remains incomplete. Theoretical models of leaf habit assume that a selective environment leads to convergence to an optimal leaf habit. Here we examine convergence in the physiological niche of different leaf habits.


Location

South American, African, Indo-Pacific and Australian biogeographical realms.


Methods

We delineated the distribution of three phenomes: high leaf area evergreen vegetation, low leaf area evergreen vegetation and deciduous vegetation, using a 1981--2012 time series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data from the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR). For each phenome in each of the four biogeographical realms we quantified the physiological niche using a process-based model of plant growth. The derived physiological niche dimensions of each phenome in each realm were used to project its potential distribution into other, non-native, realms. Convergence in leaf habit was quantified as the level of consistency among the projections from all realms.


Results

The overall agreement between observed and predicted phenomes in the native realm was high (80\%), suggesting that the model adequately describes the physiological niches of phenomes. Projections from each phenome into non-native realms coincided in 89\% of the study area, implying widespread convergence of the physiological niches of phenomes. For the remaining 11\% of the study area projections of all realms did not coincide, implying that the predicted phenome type is uncertain.


Main conclusions

Modelled physiological niches of the same phenome in different biogeographical realms largely overlap. This implies a dominant role for evolutionary convergence in the biogeography of leaf habit. Overall, our analysis therefore suggests that the impact of global change on the geographical distribution of leaf habit can be predicted by relatively simple physiological models. Potential explanations for non-convergence on 11\% of the study area include historical contingencies and alternative stable states.},

@article{cabral_mechanistic_2016,
	Abstract = {Macroecology and biogeography are concerned with understanding biodiversity patterns across space and time. In the past, the two disciplines have addressed this question mainly with correlative approaches, despite frequent calls for more mechanistic explanations. Recent advances in computational power, theoretical understanding, and statistical tools are, however, currently facilitating the development of more system-oriented, mechanistic models. We review these models, identify different model types and theoretical frameworks, compare their processes and properties, and summarize emergent findings. We show that ecological (physiology, demographics, dispersal, biotic interactions) and evolutionary processes, as well as environmental and human-induced drivers, are increasingly modelled mechanistically; and that new insights into biodiversity dynamics emerge from these models. Yet, substantial challenges still lie ahead for this young research field. Among these, we identify scaling, calibration, validation, and balancing complexity as pressing issues. Moreover, particular process combinations are still understudied, and so far models tend to be developed for specific applications. Future work should aim at developing more flexible and modular models that not only allow different ecological theories to be expressed and contrasted, but which are also built for tight integration with all macroecological data sources. Moving the field towards such a `systems macroecology' will test and improve our understanding of the causal pathways through which eco-evolutionary processes create diversity patterns across spatial and temporal scales.},

@article{arora_fire_2005,
	Abstract = {Fire affects ecosystems by altering both their structure and the cycling of carbon and nutrients. The emissions from fires represent an important biogeochemical pathway by which the biosphere affects climate. For climate change studies it is important to model fire as a mechanistic climate-dependent process in dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) and the terrestrial ecosystem components of climate models. We expand on those current approaches which neglect disturbance by fire, which use constant specified loss rates, or which depend on simple empirical relationships, and develop a process-based fire parameterization for use in the terrestrial ecosystem components of climate and Earth system models. The approach is straightforward and general enough to apply globally and for current and future climates. All three aspects of the fire triangle, fuel availability, the readiness of fuel to burn depending on conditions, and the presence of an ignition source, are taken into account. The approach also represents some anthropogenic effects on natural fire regimes, albeit in a simple manner. The fire parameterization is incorporated in the Canadian Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (CTEM) which simulates net primary productivity, leaf area index, and vegetation biomass. The fire parameterization generates burned area, alters vegetation biomass, and generates CO2 emissions. The parameterization is tested by comparing simulated fire return intervals and CO2 emissions with observation-based estimates for tropical savanna, tropical humid forests, mediterranean, and boreal forest locations.},

@article{pausas_flammability_2017,
	Abstract = {* We live on a flammable planet yet there is little consensus on the origin and evolution of flammability in our flora.


* We argue that part of the problem lies in the concept of flammability, which should not be viewed as a single quantitative trait or metric. Rather, we propose that flammability has three major dimensions that are not necessarily correlated: ignitability, heat release and fire spread rate. These major axes of variation are controlled by different plant traits and have differing ecological impacts during fire.


* At the individual plant scale, these traits define three flammability strategies observed in fire-prone ecosystems: the non-flammable, the fast-flammable and the hot-flammable strategy (with low ignitability, high flame spread rate and high heat release, respectively). These strategies increase the survival or reproduction under recurrent fires, and thus, plants in fire-prone ecosystems benefit from acquiring one of them; they represent different (alternative) ways to live under recurrent fires.


* Synthesis. This novel framework based on different flammability strategies helps us to understand variability in flammability across scales, and provides a basis for further research.},

@article{hickler_modelling_2015,
	Abstract = {Process-based models are important tools for understanding the dynamics and functioning of forest ecosystems. In nearly all models, forest productivity is largely driven by carbon (C) input via photosynthesis, which reacts strongly positive to elevated CO2 (eCO2). The simulated increases in forest productivity in terms of wood production, however, have been much higher than experimental and observational evidence suggests, at least in those models that did not account for nutrient limitations. Experimental results show that in most investigated systems, eCO2 leads to increasing allocation of C below ground, without sustained enhancements of wood production. This translocation of C below ground, which also enhances nutrient uptake, appears to be larger than simulated in our current models. However, because of a lack of experimental data from real ecosystems, in particular from the tropics, the big question remains unresolved whether increasing levels of CO2 have and will lead to substantially increased forest productivity in terms of stand-level wood increment. To reduce the uncertainties, it will be necessary to develop new theory, implement that in models, and rigorously compare model results with observations. They range from physiological measurements, results from ``free air CO2 enrichment'' experiments to forest inventories, tree rings and 13C analyses (as a proxy for changes in water use efficiency). Key issues that should be addressed in the models include the coupling of C and nutrient cycles, limitations to the C sink capacity of trees, dynamic changes in allocation, and potential feedbacks from tree population dynamics on stand productivity.},

	Abstract = {Understanding tree growth in response to rainfall distribution is critical to predicting forest and species population responses to climate change. We investigated inter-annual and seasonal variation in stem diameter by three emergent tree species in a seasonally dry tropical forest in southeast Par{\'a}, Brazil. Annual diameter growth rates by Swietenia macrophylla demonstrated strong positive correlation with annual rainfall totals during 1997--2009; Hymenaea courbaril growth rates demonstrated weak positive correlation, whereas Parkia pendula exhibited weak negative correlation. For both Swietenia and Hymenaea, annual diameter growth rates correlated positively and significantly with rainfall totals during the first 6 mo of the growing year (July to December). Vernier dendrometer bands monitored at 4-wk intervals during 3--5 yr confirmed strong seasonal effects on stem diameter expansion. Individuals of all three species expanded in unison during wet season months and were static or even contracted during dry season months. Stems of the deciduous Swietenia contracted as crowns were shed during the early dry season, expanded slightly as new crowns were flushed, and then contracted further during 3--5 wk flowering periods in the late dry season by newly mature crowns. The three species' physiographic distribution patterns at the study site may partially underlie observed differences in annual and seasonal growth. With most global circulation models predicting conditions becoming gradually drier in southeast Amazonia over the coming decades, species such as Swietenia that perform best on the `wet end' of current conditions may experience reduced growth rates. However, population viability will not necessarily be threatened if life history and ecophysiological responses to changing conditions are compensatory.},

	Abstract = {The extent of the savannah biome is expected to be profoundly altered by climatic change and increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Contrasting projections are given when using different modelling approaches to estimate future distributions. Furthermore, biogeographic variation within savannahs in plant function and structure is expected to lead to divergent responses to global change. Hence the use of a single model with a single savannah tree type will likely lead to biased projections. Here we compare and contrast projections of South American, African and Australian savannah distributions from the physiologically based Thornley transport resistance statistical distribution model (TTR-SDM)---and three versions of a dynamic vegetation model (DVM) designed and parametrized separately for specific continents. We show that attempting to extrapolate any continent-specific model globally biases projections. By 2070, all DVMs generally project a decrease in the extent of savannahs at their boundary with forests, whereas the TTR-SDM projects a decrease in savannahs at their boundary with aridlands and grasslands. This difference is driven by forest and woodland expansion in response to rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations in DVMs, unaccounted for by the TTR-SDM. We suggest that the most suitable models of the savannah biome for future development are individual-based dynamic vegetation models designed for specific biogeographic regions.This article is part of the themed issue `Tropical grassy biomes: linking ecology, human use and conservation'.},

@article{isbell_biodiversity_2015,
	Abstract = {It remains unclear whether biodiversity buffers ecosystems against climate extremes, which are becoming increasingly frequent worldwide. Early results suggested that the ecosystem productivity of diverse grassland plant communities was more resistant, changing less during drought, and more resilient, recovering more quickly after drought, than that of depauperate communities. However, subsequent experimental tests produced mixed results. Here we use data from 46 experiments that manipulated grassland plant diversity to test whether biodiversity provides resistance during and resilience after climate events. We show that biodiversity increased ecosystem resistance for a broad range of climate events, including wet or dry, moderate or extreme, and brief or prolonged events. Across all studies and climate events, the productivity of low-diversity communities with one or two species changed by approximately 50\% during climate events, whereas that of high-diversity communities with 16--32 species was more resistant, changing by only approximately 25\%. By a year after each climate event, ecosystem productivity had often fully recovered, or overshot, normal levels of productivity in both high- and low-diversity communities, leading to no detectable dependence of ecosystem resilience on biodiversity. Our results suggest that biodiversity mainly stabilizes ecosystem productivity, and productivity-dependent ecosystem services, by increasing resistance to climate events. Anthropogenic environmental changes that drive biodiversity loss thus seem likely to decrease ecosystem stability, and restoration of biodiversity to increase it, mainly by changing the resistance of ecosystem productivity to climate events.},

@article{sakschewski_resilience_2016,
	Abstract = {Climate change threatens ecosystems worldwide, yet their potential future resilience remains largely unquantified. In recent years many studies have shown that biodiversity, and in particular functional diversity, can enhance ecosystem resilience by providing a higher response diversity. So far these insights have been mostly neglected in large-scale projections of ecosystem responses to climate change. Here we show that plant trait diversity, as a key component of functional diversity, can have a strikingly positive effect on the Amazon forests' biomass under future climate change. Using a terrestrial biogeochemical model that simulates diverse forest communities on the basis of individual tree growth, we show that plant trait diversity may enable the Amazon forests to adjust to new climate conditions via a process of ecological sorting, protecting the Amazon's carbon sink function. Therefore, plant trait diversity, and biodiversity in general, should be considered in large-scale ecosystem projections and be included as an integral part of climate change research and policy.},

@article{pfeiffer_model_2013-1,
	Abstract = {Fire is the primary disturbance factor in many terrestrial ecosystems. Wildfire alters vegetation structure and composition, affects carbon storage and biogeochemical cycling, and results in the release of climatically relevant trace gases including CO2, CO, CH4, NOx, and aerosols. One way of assessing the impacts of global wildfire on centennial to multi-millennial timescales is to use process-based fire models linked to dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs). Here we present an update to the LPJ-DGVM and a new fire module based on SPITFIRE that includes several improvements to the way in which fire occurrence, behaviour, and the effects of fire on vegetation are simulated. The new LPJ-LMfire model includes explicit calculation of natural ignitions, the representation of multi-day burning and coalescence of fires, and the calculation of rates of spread in different vegetation types. We describe a new representation of anthropogenic biomass burning under preindustrial conditions that distinguishes the different relationships between humans and fire among hunter-gatherers, pastoralists, and farmers. We evaluate our model simulations against remote-sensing-based estimates of burned area at regional and global scale. While wildfire in much of the modern world is largely influenced by anthropogenic suppression and ignitions, in those parts of the world where natural fire is still the dominant process (e.g. in remote areas of the boreal forest and subarctic), our results demonstrate a significant improvement in simulated burned area over the original SPITFIRE. The new fire model we present here is particularly suited for the investigation of climate--human--fire relationships on multi-millennial timescales prior to the Industrial Revolution.},

@article{korner_carbon_2003,
	Abstract = {* 1The ongoing enrichment of the atmosphere with CO2 raises the question of whether growth of forest trees, which represent close to 90\% of the global biomass carbon, is still carbon limited at current concentrations of close to 370 p.p.m. As photosynthesis of C3 plants is not CO2-saturated at such concentrations, enhanced `source activity' of leaves could stimulate `sink activity' (i.e. growth) of plants, provided other resources and developmental controls permit. I explore current levels of non-structural carbon in trees in natural forests in order to estimate the potential for a carbon-driven stimulation of growth.
* 2The concentration of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) in tree tissues is considered a measure of carbon shortage or surplus for growth. A periodic reduction of NSC pools indicates either that carbon demand exceeds con-current supply, or that both source and sink activity are low. A steady, very high NSC concentration is likely to indicate that photosynthesis fully meets, or even exeeds, that needed for growth (surplus assimilates accumulate).
* 3The analysis presented here considers data for mature trees in four climatic zones: the high elevation treeline (in Mexico, the Alps and Northern Sweden), a temperate lowland forest of central Europe, Mediterranean sclerophyllous woodland and a semideciduous tropical forest in Panama.
* 4In all four climatic regions, periods of reduced or zero growth show maximum C-loading of trees (source activity exceeding demand), except for dry midsummer in the Mediterranean. NSC pools are generally high throughout the year, and are not significantly affected by mass fruiting episodes.
* 5It is concluded that, irrespective of the reason for its periodic cessation, growth does not seem to be limited by carbon supply. Instead, in all the cases examined, sink activity and its direct control by the environment or developmental constraints, restricts biomass production of trees under current ambient CO2 concentrations.
* 6The current carbohydrate charging of mature wild trees from the tropics to the cold limit of tree growth suggests that little (if any) leeway exists for further CO2-fertilization effects on growth.},

@article{waide_relationship_1999,
	Abstract = {Recent overviews have suggested that the relationship between species richness and productivity (rate of conversion of resources to biomass per unit area per unit time) is unimodal (hump-shaped). Most agree that productivity affects species richness at large scales, but unanimity is less regarding underlying mechanisms. Recent studies have examined the possibility that variation in species richness within communities may influence productivity, leading to an exploration of the relative effect of alterations in species number per se as contrasted to the addition of productive species. Reviews of the literature concerning deserts, boreal forests, tropical forests, lakes, and wetlands lead to the conclusion that extant data are insufficient to conclusively resolve the relationship between diversity and productivity, or that patterns are variable with mechanisms equally varied and complex. A more comprehensive survey of the ecological literature uncovered approximately 200 relationships, of which 30\% were unimodal, 26\% were positive linear, 12\% were negative linear, and 32\% were not significant. Categorization of studies with respect to geographic extent, ecological extent, taxonomic hierarchy, or energetic basis of productivity similarly yielded a heterogeneous distribution of relationships. Theoretical and empirical approaches increasingly suggest scale-dependence in the relationship between species richness and productivity; consequently, synthetic understanding may be contingent on explicit considerations of scale in analytical studies of productivity and diversity.},

@article{ter_steege_hyperdominance_2013-1,
	Abstract = {Introduction Recent decades have seen a major international effort to inventory tree communities in the Amazon Basin and Guiana Shield (Amazonia), but the vast extent and record diversity of these forests have hampered an understanding of basinwide patterns. To overcome this obstacle, we compiled and standardized species-level data on more than half a million trees in 1170 plots sampling all major lowland forest types to explore patterns of commonness, rarity, and richness. A map of Amazonia showing the location of the 1430 Amazon Tree Diversity Network (ATDN) plots that contributed data to this paper. The white polygon marks our delimitation of the study area and consists of 567 1$\,^{\circ}$ grid cells (area = 6.29 million km2). Orange circles indicate plots on terra firme; blue squares, plots on seasonally or permanently flooded terrain (v{\'a}rzea, igap{\'o}, swamps); yellow triangles, plots on white-sand podzols; gray circles, plots only used for tree density calculations. Background is from Visible Earth. CA, central Amazonia; EA, eastern Amazonia; GS, Guyana Shield; SA, southern Amazonia; WAN, northern part of western Amazonia; WAS, southern part of western Amazonia. More details are shown in figs. S1 to S3. Methods The 6-million-km2 Amazonian lowlands were divided into 1$\,^{\circ}$ cells, and mean tree density was estimated for each cell by using a loess regression model that included no environmental data but had its basis exclusively in the geographic location of tree plots. A similar model, allied with a bootstrapping exercise to quantify sampling error, was used to generate estimated Amazon-wide abundances of the 4962 valid species in the data set. We estimated the total number of tree species in the Amazon by fitting the mean rank-abundance data to Fisher's log-series distribution. Results Our analyses suggest that lowland Amazonia harbors 3.9 × 1011 trees and 16,000 tree species. We found 227 ``hyperdominant'' species (1.4\% of the total) to be so common that together they account for half of all trees in Amazonia, whereas the rarest 11,000 species account for just 0.12\% of trees. Most hyperdominants are habitat specialists that have large geographic ranges but are only dominant in one or two regions of the basin, and a median of 41\% of trees in individual plots belong to hyperdominants. A disproportionate number of hyperdominants are palms, Myristicaceae, and Lecythidaceae. Discussion The finding that Amazonia is dominated by just 227 tree species implies that most biogeochemical cycling in the world's largest tropical forest is performed by a tiny sliver of its diversity. The causes underlying hyperdominance in these species remain unknown. Both competitive superiority and widespread pre-1492 cultivation by humans are compelling hypotheses that deserve testing. Although the data suggest that spatial models can effectively forecast tree community composition and structure of unstudied sites in Amazonia, incorporating environmental data may yield substantial improvements. An appreciation of how thoroughly common species dominate the basin has the potential to simplify research in Amazonian biogeochemistry, ecology, and vegetation mapping. Such advances are urgently needed in light of the \&gt;10,000 rare, poorly known, and potentially threatened tree species in the Amazon. Despite botanical exploration over two centuries, knowledge of the species composition and quantitative distribution of the trees of the Amazonian forest has remained decidedly patchy. Ter Steege et al. (1243092) report the results from a network of 1170 tree plots arrayed across the Amazon Basin and Guiana Shield, in which the species of all trees with stem diameter \&gt;10 centimeters were identified. The tree flora comprised a total of about 16,000 species. However, just 227 very common Amazonian species accounted for half of the trees in the Amazon---the world's most diverse forest. The vast extent of the Amazon Basin has historically restricted the study of its tree communities to the local and regional scales. Here, we provide empirical data on the commonness, rarity, and richness of lowland tree species across the entire Amazon Basin and Guiana Shield (Amazonia), collected in 1170 tree plots in all major forest types. Extrapolations suggest that Amazonia harbors roughly 16,000 tree species, of which just 227 (1.4\%) account for half of all trees. Most of these are habitat specialists and only dominant in one or two regions of the basin. We discuss some implications of the finding that a small group of species---less diverse than the North American tree flora---accounts for half of the world's most diverse tree community.},

	Abstract = {Introduction Recent decades have seen a major international effort to inventory tree communities in the Amazon Basin and Guiana Shield (Amazonia), but the vast extent and record diversity of these forests have hampered an understanding of basinwide patterns. To overcome this obstacle, we compiled and standardized species-level data on more than half a million trees in 1170 plots sampling all major lowland forest types to explore patterns of commonness, rarity, and richness. A map of Amazonia showing the location of the 1430 Amazon Tree Diversity Network (ATDN) plots that contributed data to this paper. The white polygon marks our delimitation of the study area and consists of 567 1$\,^{\circ}$ grid cells (area = 6.29 million km2). Orange circles indicate plots on terra firme; blue squares, plots on seasonally or permanently flooded terrain (v{\'a}rzea, igap{\'o}, swamps); yellow triangles, plots on white-sand podzols; gray circles, plots only used for tree density calculations. Background is from Visible Earth. CA, central Amazonia; EA, eastern Amazonia; GS, Guyana Shield; SA, southern Amazonia; WAN, northern part of western Amazonia; WAS, southern part of western Amazonia. More details are shown in figs. S1 to S3. Methods The {\textasciitilde}6-million-km2 Amazonian lowlands were divided into 1$\,^{\circ}$ cells, and mean tree density was estimated for each cell by using a loess regression model that included no environmental data but had its basis exclusively in the geographic location of tree plots. A similar model, allied with a bootstrapping exercise to quantify sampling error, was used to generate estimated Amazon-wide abundances of the 4962 valid species in the data set. We estimated the total number of tree species in the Amazon by fitting the mean rank-abundance data to Fisher's log-series distribution. Results Our analyses suggest that lowland Amazonia harbors 3.9 × 1011 trees and {\textasciitilde}16,000 tree species. We found 227 ``hyperdominant'' species (1.4\% of the total) to be so common that together they account for half of all trees in Amazonia, whereas the rarest 11,000 species account for just 0.12\% of trees. Most hyperdominants are habitat specialists that have large geographic ranges but are only dominant in one or two regions of the basin, and a median of 41\% of trees in individual plots belong to hyperdominants. A disproportionate number of hyperdominants are palms, Myristicaceae, and Lecythidaceae. Discussion The finding that Amazonia is dominated by just 227 tree species implies that most biogeochemical cycling in the world's largest tropical forest is performed by a tiny sliver of its diversity. The causes underlying hyperdominance in these species remain unknown. Both competitive superiority and widespread pre-1492 cultivation by humans are compelling hypotheses that deserve testing. Although the data suggest that spatial models can effectively forecast tree community composition and structure of unstudied sites in Amazonia, incorporating environmental data may yield substantial improvements. An appreciation of how thoroughly common species dominate the basin has the potential to simplify research in Amazonian biogeochemistry, ecology, and vegetation mapping. Such advances are urgently needed in light of the \&gt;10,000 rare, poorly known, and potentially threatened tree species in the Amazon. Despite botanical exploration over two centuries, knowledge of the species composition and quantitative distribution of the trees of the Amazonian forest has remained decidedly patchy. Ter Steege et al. (1243092) report the results from a network of 1170 tree plots arrayed across the Amazon Basin and Guiana Shield, in which the species of all trees with stem diameter \&gt;10 centimeters were identified. The tree flora comprised a total of about 16,000 species. However, just 227 very common Amazonian species accounted for half of the trees in the Amazon---the world's most diverse forest. The vast extent of the Amazon Basin has historically restricted the study of its tree communities to the local and regional scales. Here, we provide empirical data on the commonness, rarity, and richness of lowland tree species across the entire Amazon Basin and Guiana Shield (Amazonia), collected in 1170 tree plots in all major forest types. Extrapolations suggest that Amazonia harbors roughly 16,000 tree species, of which just 227 (1.4\%) account for half of all trees. Most of these are habitat specialists and only dominant in one or two regions of the basin. We discuss some implications of the finding that a small group of species---less diverse than the North American tree flora---accounts for half of the world's most diverse tree community.},

@article{goll_representation_2017,
	Abstract = {Land surface models rarely incorporate the terrestrial phosphorus cycle and its interactions with the carbon cycle, despite the extensive scientific debate about the importance of nitrogen and phosphorus supply for future land carbon uptake. We describe a representation of the terrestrial phosphorus cycle for the land surface model ORCHIDEE, and evaluate it with data from nutrient manipulation experiments along a soil formation chronosequence in Hawaii.  ORCHIDEE accounts for influence of nutritional state of vegetation on tissue nutrient concentrations, photosynthesis, plant growth, biomass allocation, biochemical (phosphatase-mediated) mineralization and biological nitrogen fixation. Changes in nutrient content (quality) of litter affect the carbon use efficiency of decomposition and in return the nutrient availability to vegetation. The model explicitly accounts for root zone depletion of phosphorus as a function of root phosphorus uptake and phosphorus transport from soil to the root surface.  The model captures the observed differences in the foliage stoichiometry of vegetation between an early (300yr) and a late stage (4.1 Myr) of soil development. The contrasting sensitivities of net primary productivity to the addition of either nitrogen, phosphorus or both among sites are in general reproduced by the model. As observed, the model simulates a preferential stimulation of leaf level productivity when nitrogen stress is alleviated, while leaf level productivity and leaf area index are stimulated equally when phosphorus stress is alleviated. The nutrient use efficiencies in the model are lower as observed primarily due to biases in the nutrient content and turnover of woody biomass.  We conclude that ORCHIDEE is able to reproduce the shift from nitrogen to phosphorus limited net primary productivity along the soil development chronosequence, as well as the contrasting responses of net primary productivity to nutrient addition.},

@article{hoch_global_2012,
	Abstract = {Aim  Across all latitudes, high-elevation tree lines represent a drastic change in the dominant plant life-form, from upright trees to low-stature alpine plants. Although associated with low temperatures, the physiological mechanisms controlling this boundary are still not clear. The growth-limitation hypothesis assumes a direct low-temperature restriction of tissue formation at otherwise sufficient photoassimilation. In order to test this hypothesis, we present a global synthesis of previously published and new data on tree carbon supply status at high-elevation tree lines. Location  Global; 13 regions between 68$\,^{\circ}$ N and 45$\,^{\circ}$ S. Methods  Late-season concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) in foliage and branch wood were measured at three elevations across the tree line ecotones, from upper tall forests (timber line) to the edges of aborescent tree growth (tree line). Year-round records of −10 cm soil temperatures were taken at the tree line. Results  Despite large differences in elevation and season length, the mean growing season temperature at the tree line was similar (approximately 6.6 $\,^{\circ}$C) between all sites. NSC concentrations were not depleted at any of the elevation gradients between timber line and tree line, indicating no shortage of C at the uppermost tree stands. Tested across all sites, NSC concentrations in fact significantly increased with elevation. On average, NSC increased by 18\% in leaves and 26\% in branch wood from the lowest to the highest stands, primarily due to higher starch concentrations rather than free sugars. Hence, these responses do not reflect osmotic adjustments to lower temperatures at the end of the growing season. Main conclusions  This global data set contributes to a mechanistic understanding of tree line formation based on biological principles across climatic zones and tree genera. No evidence of C shortage was found at the high-elevation tree line in either seasonal and non-seasonal regions. The increasing trend of NSC concentrations with elevation is in line with the growth-limitation hypothesis.},

@article{brando_drought_2008,
	Abstract = {The Amazon Basin experiences severe droughts that may become more common in the future. Little is known of the effects of such droughts on Amazon forest productivity and carbon allocation. We tested the prediction that severe drought decreases litterfall and wood production but potentially has multiple cancelling effects on belowground production within a 7-year partial throughfall exclusion experiment. We simulated an approximately 35--41\% reduction in effective rainfall from 2000 through 2004 in a 1 ha plot and compared forest response with a similar control plot. Wood production was the most sensitive component of above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) to drought, declining by 13\% the first year and up to 62\% thereafter. Litterfall declined only in the third year of drought, with a maximum difference of 23\% below the control plot. Soil CO2 efflux and its 14C signature showed no significant treatment response, suggesting similar amounts and sources of belowground production. ANPP was similar between plots in 2000 and declined to a low of 41\% below the control plot during the subsequent treatment years, rebounding to only a 10\% difference during the first post-treatment year. Live aboveground carbon declined by 32.5 Mg ha−1 through the effects of drought on ANPP and tree mortality. Results of this unreplicated, long-term, large-scale ecosystem manipulation experiment demonstrate that multi-year severe drought can substantially reduce Amazon forest carbon stocks.},

@article{brando_abrupt_2014,
	Abstract = {Interactions between climate and land-use change may drive widespread degradation of Amazonian forests. High-intensity fires associated with extreme weather events could accelerate this degradation by abruptly increasing tree mortality, but this process remains poorly understood. Here we present, to our knowledge, the first field-based evidence of a tipping point in Amazon forests due to altered fire regimes. Based on results of a large-scale, long-term experiment with annual and triennial burn regimes (B1yr and B3yr, respectively) in the Amazon, we found abrupt increases in fire-induced tree mortality (226 and 462\%) during a severe drought event, when fuel loads and air temperatures were substantially higher and relative humidity was lower than long-term averages. This threshold mortality response had a cascading effect, causing sharp declines in canopy cover (23 and 31\%) and aboveground live biomass (12 and 30\%) and favoring widespread invasion by flammable grasses across the forest edge area (80 and 63\%), where fires were most intense (e.g., 220 and 820 kW⋅m−1). During the droughts of 2007 and 2010, regional forest fires burned 12 and 5\% of southeastern Amazon forests, respectively, compared with {\textless}1\% in nondrought years. These results show that a few extreme drought events, coupled with forest fragmentation and anthropogenic ignition sources, are already causing widespread fire-induced tree mortality and forest degradation across southeastern Amazon forests. Future projections of vegetation responses to climate change across drier portions of the Amazon require more than simulation of global climate forcing alone and must also include interactions of extreme weather events, fire, and land-use change.},

@article{huston_hidden_1997,
	Abstract = {Interactions between biotic and abiotic processes complicate the design and interpretation of ecological experiments. Separating causality from simple correlation requires distinguishing among experimental treatments, experimental responses, and the many processes and properties that are correlated with either the treatments or the responses, or both. When an experimental manipulation has multiple components, but only one of them is identified as the experimental treatment, erroneous conclusions about cause and effect relationships are likely because the actual cause of any observed response may be ignored in the interpretation of the experimental results. This unrecognized cause of an observed response can be considered a ``hidden treatment.'' Three types of hidden treatments are potential problems in biodiversity experiments: (1) abiotic conditions, such as resource levels, or biotic conditions, such as predation, which are intentionally or unintentionally altered in order to create differences in species numbers for ``diversity'' treatments; (2) non-random selection of species with particular attributes that produce treatment differences that exceed those due to ``diversity'' alone; and (3) the increased statistical probability of including a species with a dominant negative or positive effect (e.g., dense shade, or nitrogen fixation) in randomly selected groups of species of increasing number or ``diversity.'' In each of these cases, treatment responses that are actually the result of the ``hidden treatment'' may be inadvertently attributed to variation in species diversity. Case studies re-evaluating three different types of biodiversity experiments demonstrate that the increases found in such ecosystem properties as productivity, nutrient use efficiency, and stability (all of which were attributed to higher levels of species diversity) were actually caused by ``hidden treatments'' that altered plant biomass and productivity.},

@article{tilman_biodiversity:_1996,
	Abstract = {The relationships between biodiversity and stability were determined for both population and ecosystem traits in a long-term study of 207 grassland plots. Results demonstrate that biodiversity stabilizes community and ecosystem processes, but not population processes. Specifically, year-to-year variability in total aboveground plant community biomass was significantly lower in plots with greater plant species richness both for the entire 11-yr period and for the nine non-drought years. The change in total plant community biomass from before the drought to the peak of the drought was also highly dependent on species richness. For all three measures of total community biomass stability, multiple regressions that controlled for covariates showed similar significant relationships between plant diversity and stability. In contrast, year-to-year variability in species abundances was not stabilized by plant species richness for either all years or non-drought years. This difference between species vs. community biomass likely results from interspecific competition. When climatic variations harm some species, unharmed competitors increase. Such compensatory increases stabilize total community biomass, but cause species abundances to be more variable. These results support both the predictions of Robert May concerning the effects of diversity on population stability and the diversity-stability hypothesis as applied to community and ecosystem processes, thus helping to reconcile a long-standing dispute.},

@article{langan_climate-biomes_2017,
	Abstract = {Aim

It remains poorly understood why the position of the forest--savanna biome boundary, in a domain defined by precipitation and temperature, differs in South America, Africa and Australia. Process based Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) are a valuable tool to investigate the determinants of vegetation distributions; however, many DGVMs fail to predict the spatial distribution or indeed presence of the South American savanna biome. Evidence suggests that fire plays a significant role in mediating forest--savanna biome boundaries; however, fire alone appears to be insufficient to predict these boundaries in South America. We hypothesize that interactions between precipitation, constraints on tree rooting depth and fire affect the probability of savanna occurrence and the position of the savanna--forest boundary.


Location

Tropical forest and savanna sites in Brazil and Venezuela north of 23∘S.


Methods

We tested our hypotheses using a novel DGVM, aDGVM2, which allows plant trait spectra, constrained by trade-offs between traits, to evolve in response to abiotic and biotic conditions. Plant hydraulics is represented by the cohesion--tension theory, this allowed us to explore how soil and plant hydraulics control biome distributions and plant traits. The resulting community trait distributions are emergent properties of model dynamics.


Results

We showed that across much of South America the biome state is not determined by climate alone. Interactions between plant rooting depth, fire and precipitation affected the probability of observing a given biome state and the emergent traits of plant communities. Simulations where plant rooting depth varied in space provided the best match to satellite derived biomass estimates and generated biome distributions that reproduced contemporary biome maps well.


Main conclusions

Our findings support the contention that areas where multiple vegetation states are possible are widespread and highlight the importance of considering the influence of fire and constraints on plant rooting depth for predicting biome boundaries.},

@article{finegan_does_2015,
	Abstract = {* Tropical forests are globally important, but it is not clear whether biodiversity enhances carbon storage and sequestration in them. We tested this relationship focusing on components of functional trait biodiversity as predictors.


* Data are presented for three rain forests in Bolivia, Brazil and Costa Rica. Initial above-ground biomass and biomass increments of survivors, recruits and survivors + recruits (total) were estimated for trees ≥10 cm d.b.h. in 62 and 21 1.0-ha plots, respectively. We determined relationships of biomass increments to initial standing biomass (AGBi), biomass-weighted community mean values (CWM) of eight functional traits and four functional trait variety indices (functional richness, functional evenness, functional diversity and functional dispersion).


* The forest continuum sampled ranged from `slow' stands dominated by trees with tough tissues and high AGBi, to `fast' stands dominated by trees with soft, nutrient-rich leaves, lighter woods and lower AGBi.


* We tested whether AGBi and biomass increments were related to the CWM trait values of the dominant species in the system (the biomass ratio hypothesis), to the variety of functional trait values (the niche complementarity hypothesis), or in the case of biomass increments, simply to initial standing biomass (the green soup hypothesis).


* CWMs were reasonable bivariate predictors of AGBi and biomass increments, with CWM specific leaf area SLA, CWM leaf nitrogen content, CWM force to tear the leaf, CWM maximum adult height Hmax and CWM wood specific gravity the most important. AGBi was also a reasonable predictor of the three measures of biomass increment. In best-fit multiple regression models, CWMHmax was the most important predictor of initial standing biomass AGBi. Only leaf traits were selected in the best models for biomass increment; CWM SLA was the most important predictor, with the expected positive relationship. There were no relationships of functional variety indices to biomass increments, and AGBi was the only predictor for biomass increments from recruits.


* Synthesis. We found no support for the niche complementarity hypothesis and support for the green soup hypothesis only for biomass increments of recruits. We have strong support for the biomass ratio hypothesis. CWMHmax is a strong driver of ecosystem biomass and carbon storage and CWM SLA, and other CWM leaf traits are especially important for biomass increments and carbon sequestration.},

	Abstract = {Living trees constitute one of the major stocks of carbon in tropical forests. A better understanding of variations in the dynamics and structure of tropical forests is necessary for predicting the potential for these ecosystems to lose or store carbon, and for understanding how they recover from disturbance. Amazonian tropical forests occur over a vast area that encompasses differences in topography, climate, and geologic substrate. We observed large differences in forest structure, biomass, and tree growth rates in permanent plots situated in the eastern (near Santar{\'e}m, Par{\'a}), central (near Manaus, Amazonas) and southwestern (near Rio Branco, Acre) Amazon, which differed in dry season length, as well as other factors. Forests at the two sites experiencing longer dry seasons, near Rio Branco and Santar{\'e}m, had lower stem frequencies (460 and 466 ha⁻1 respectively), less biodiversity (Shannon-Wiener diversity index), and smaller aboveground C stocks (140.6 and 122.1 Mg C ha⁻1) then the Manaus site (626 trees ha⁻1, 180.1 Mg C ha⁻1), which had less seasonal variation in rainfall. The forests experiencing longer dry seasons also stored a greater proportion of the total biomass in trees with {\textgreater}50 cm diameter (41-45 vs 30\% in manaus). Rates of annual addition of C to living trees calculated from monthly dendrometer band measurements were 1.9 (manaus), 2.8 (santar{\'e}m), and 2.6 (Rio Branco) Mg ha⁻1 year⁻. At all sites, trees in the 10-30 cm diameter class accou nted for the highest proportion of annual growth (38,55 and 56\% in manaus, Rio Branco and santar{\'e}m, respectively). Growth showed marked seasonality, with largest stem diameter increment in the wet season and smallest in the dry season, though this may be confounded by seasonal variation in wood water content. Year-to-year variations in C allocated to stem growth ranged from nearly zero in Rio Branco, to 0.8 Mg C h⁻1 year⁻1 in Manaus (40\% of annual mean) and 0.9 Mg C ha⁻1 year⁻1 (33\% of annual mean) in Santar{\'e}m, though this variability showed no significant relation with precipitation among years. Initial estimates of the C balance of live wood including recruitment and mortality as well as growth suggests that live biomass is at near steady-state in Manaus, but accumalating at about 1.5 Mg C ⁻ at the other two sites. The causes of C imbalance in living wood pools in santar{\'e}m and Ria Branco sites are unknown, but may be related to previous disturbance at these sites. Based on size distribution and growth rate diffrences in the three sides, we predict that trees in the Manaus forest have greater mean age ({\textasciitilde}240 years) than those of the other two forests({\textasciitilde}140 years)},

	Abstract = {We derive and test some assumptions and predictions of the Sampling Effect Hypothesis (SEH) by examining the relationship between the traits of species in monoculture and their relative abundance in mixture, and by comparing polyculture performance with single-species plots. Although we found a positive relationship between production in monoculture and dominance in mixtures as predicted by the SEH, the relationship had low explanatory power. Counter to predictions, the species with the highest monoculture biomass were not able to strongly dominate all mixtures; instead the dominance of these species decreased with increasing species richness. On average, polycultures did not achieve greater biomass than (transgressively overyield) the species in each mixture, or at each site, that was most productive in monoculture. However, mixture yields did transgressively overyield both the monoculture biomass of the dominant species in the mixtures, and the weighted average of all monocultures (non-transgressive overyielding), both of which were positively related to increasing species richness. The varying responses of different overyielding tests resulted because resource partitioning and positive interactions were often counter-balanced by selection for species with lower biomass than the highest-yielding monocultures. Judging whether or not mixtures overyield therefore depends in part upon which species is the basis for comparison. We present a new general framework for overyielding analysis where every monoculture provides a potential comparison and from which the most relevant tests can be selected.},

@article{andersen_stoichiometry_2004,
	Abstract = {Population dynamics theory forms the quantitative core from which most ecologists have developed their intuition about how species interactions, heterogeneity, and biodiversity play out in time. Throughout its development, theoretical population biology has built on variants of the Lotka--Volterra equations and in nearly all cases has taken a single-currency approach to understanding population change, abstracting populations as aggregations of individuals or biomass. In this review, we explore how depicting organisms as built of more than one thing (for example, C and an important nutrient, such as P) in stoichiometrically explicit models results in qualitatively different predictions about the resulting dynamics. Fundamentally, stoichiometric models incorporate both food quantity and food quality effects in a single framework, allow key feedbacks such as consumer-driven nutrient recycling to occur, and generally appear to stabilize predator--prey systems while simultaneously producing rich dynamics with alternative domains of attraction and occasionally counterintuitive outcomes, such as coexistence of more than one predator species on a single-prey item and decreased herbivore performance in response to increased light intensity experienced by the autotrophs. In addition to the theoretical background, we also review recent laboratory and field studies considering stoichiometric effects on autotroph--herbivore systems, emphasizing algae--Daphnia interactions. These studies support the predictions of stoichiometric theory, providing empirical evidence for alternative stable states under stoichiometric constraints, for negative effects of solar radiation on herbivores via stoichiometric food quality, and for diversity-enhancing effects of poor food quality. Stoichiometric theory has strong potential for both quantitative and qualitative improvements in the predictive power of population ecology, a major priority in light of the multivariate anthropogenic and natural perturbations experienced by populations. However, full development and testing of stoichiometric population dynamics theory will require greater intellectual tolerance and exchange between researchers working in ecosystem and population ecology.},

@article{leroux_predator-driven_2015,
	Abstract = {Empirical evidence is beginning to show that predators can be important drivers of elemental cycling within ecosystems by propagating indirect effects that determine the distribution of elements among trophic levels as well as determine the chemical content of organic matter that becomes decomposed by microbes. These indirect effects can be propagated by predator consumptive effects on prey, nonconsumptive (risk) effects, or a combination of both. Currently, there is insufficient theory to predict how such predator effects should propagate throughout ecosystems. We present here a theoretical framework for exploring predator effects on ecosystem elemental cycling to encourage further empirical quantification. We use a classic ecosystem trophic compartment model as a basis for our analyses but infuse principles from ecological stoichiometry into the analyses of elemental cycling. Using a combined analytical-numerical approach, we compare how predators affect cycling through consumptive effects in which they control the flux of nutrients up trophic chains; through risk effects in which they change the homeostatic elemental balance of herbivore prey which accordingly changes the element ratio herbivores select from plants; and through a combination of both effects. Our analysis reveals that predators can have quantitatively important effects on elemental cycling, relative to a model formalism that excludes predator effects. Furthermore, the feedbacks due to predator nonconsumptive effects often have the quantitatively strongest impact on whole ecosystem elemental stocks, production and efficiency rates, and recycling fluxes by changing the stoichiometric balance of all trophic levels. Our modeling framework predictably shows how bottom-up control by microbes and top-down control by predators on ecosystems become interdependent when top predator effects permeate ecosystems.},

@article{hooper_role_1998,
	Abstract = {To investigate how plant diversity affects ecosystem-level processes such as primary production and nutrient cycling, I established an experimental plant diversity gradient in serpentine grassland using four functional groups of plants: early season annual forbs (E), late season annual forbs (L), perennial bunchgrasses (P), and nitrogen fixers (N). These groups differ in growth form, phenology, and other traits relevant to nutrient cycling (e.g., rooting depth, litter C:N ratio). Two or three species of each type were planted in single-group treatments, and in two-, three-, and four-way combinations, giving a range of richness from zero to nine species. I tested the hypothesis that, because of complementary resource use, increasing functional group diversity will lead to higher net primary production. At the scale of this experiment (α -diversity and yearly production), more diverse treatments were not necessarily the most productive. Live plant biomass varied more within than among levels of diversity. In most two-, three-, and four-way mixtures of functional groups, overall productivity did not differ significantly from the average of the yields of component one-group treatments. This pattern apparently resulted from competition: early season annuals and late season annuals reduced the biomass of perennial bunchgrasses (the most productive group in monoculture) below levels expected from monoculture yields. Relative Yield Totals (RYT) indicated complementary resource use in the EL and LP two-way and ELPN four-way mixtures. In the EL mixture, complementarity appeared to result from temporal rather than spatial partitioning of resources. Because of shifts in root: shoot ratio in mixtures, however, only the LP treatment had consistently significant RYT {\textgreater}1 when assessing total (roots plus shoots) productivity and nitrogen yield. These results show that (1) composition (the identity of the species present) can be at least as important as richness (the number of species present) in effects on ecosystem processes; (2) competition during critical parts of the growing season may prevent absolute increases in net primary production with increasing diversity, despite complementary resource use at other times of the year; and (3) shifts in belowground allocation in species mixtures can have significant effects on estimates of productivity and resource use as species diversity changes.},

@article{langan_climate-biomes_nodate,
	Abstract = {Aim

It remains poorly understood why the position of the forest--savanna biome boundary, in a domain defined by precipitation and temperature, differs in South America, Africa and Australia. Process based Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) are a valuable tool to investigate the determinants of vegetation distributions; however, many DGVMs fail to predict the spatial distribution or indeed presence of the South American savanna biome. Evidence suggests that fire plays a significant role in mediating forest--savanna biome boundaries; however, fire alone appears to be insufficient to predict these boundaries in South America. We hypothesize that interactions between precipitation, constraints on tree rooting depth and fire affect the probability of savanna occurrence and the position of the savanna--forest boundary.


Location

Tropical forest and savanna sites in Brazil and Venezuela north of 23∘S.


Methods

We tested our hypotheses using a novel DGVM, aDGVM2, which allows plant trait spectra, constrained by trade-offs between traits, to evolve in response to abiotic and biotic conditions. Plant hydraulics is represented by the cohesion--tension theory, this allowed us to explore how soil and plant hydraulics control biome distributions and plant traits. The resulting community trait distributions are emergent properties of model dynamics.


Results

We showed that across much of South America the biome state is not determined by climate alone. Interactions between plant rooting depth, fire and precipitation affected the probability of observing a given biome state and the emergent traits of plant communities. Simulations where plant rooting depth varied in space provided the best match to satellite derived biomass estimates and generated biome distributions that reproduced contemporary biome maps well.


Main conclusions

Our findings support the contention that areas where multiple vegetation states are possible are widespread and highlight the importance of considering the influence of fire and constraints on plant rooting depth for predicting biome boundaries.},

@article{muller_stoichiometric_2001,
	Abstract = {Herbivores may grow with nutrient or energy limitation, depending on food abundance and the chemical composition of their food. We present a model that describes herbivore growth as a continuous function of two limiting factors. This function uses the synthesizing unit concept, has the hyperbolic Monod model as a limiting case, and has the same number of parameters as the Monod model coupled to Liebig's discontinuous minimum rule. We use the model to explore nutrient-limited herbivore growth in a closed system with algae, Daphnia and phosphorus as the limiting nutrient. Phosphorus in algae may substantially influence Daphnia growth. This influence changes over time and is most pronounced when algae and Daphnia populations fluctuate strongly. Relative to classic models that only consider food quantity as a determinant of Daphnia growth, our model shows richer dynamical behaviour. In addition to the standard positive equilibrium, which may be stable or unstable depending on nutrient availability, a new positive equilibrium may arise in our model when mortality rates are relatively high. This equilibrium is unstable and reduces the likelihood of long-term persistence of Daphnia in the system.},

	Abstract = {The largest land mammals are constrained in their activities by their large body size, a theme that is emphasized in this account of their general ecology. The book begins by raising the question as to why these once abundant and widely distributed 'megaherbivores' - elephants, rhinos, hippos and giraffes - have all but gone extinct, and ends by considering the implications of the answer for the conservation of the remaining populations. Existing megaherbivores are placed in the context of the more numerous species which occurred worldwide until the end of the last Ice Age, and knowledge of the ecology of surviving species is used to analyse the cause of the extinctions. The information and ideas contained in this book are of crucial importance to all concerned with halting the rapidly worsening conservation status of remaining elephant and rhinoceros species, and carries a wider message for those concerned with the ramifying effects of man on ecosystem processes. Graduate students and research scientists in ecology, conservation biology and wildlife management will find this book of value.},

	Abstract = {* To conserve future biodiversity, a better understanding of the likely effects of climate and land-use change on the geographical distributions of species and the persistence of ecological communities is needed. Recent advances have integrated population dynamic processes into species distribution models (SDMs), to reduce potential biases in predictions and to better reflect the demographic nuances of incremental range shifts. However, there is no clear framework for selecting the most appropriate demographic-based model for a given data set or scientific question.


* We review the computer-based modelling platforms currently used for the development of either population- or individual-based species range dynamics models. We describe the features and requirements of 20 software platforms commonly used to generate simulations of species ranges and abundances. We classify the platforms according to particular capabilities or features that account for user requirements and constraints, such as (i) ability to simulate simple to complex population dynamics, (ii) organism specificity or (iii) their computational capacities.


* Using this classification, we develop a protocol for choosing the most appropriate framework for modelling species range dynamics based in data availability and research requirements. We find that the main differences between modelling platforms are related to the way in which they simulate population dynamics, the type of organisms they are able to model and the ecological processes they incorporate. We show that some platforms can be used as generic modelling software to investigate a broad range of ecological questions related to the range dynamics of most species, and how these are likely to change in the future in response to forecast climate and land-use change. We argue that model predictions will be improved by reducing usage to a smaller number of highly flexible freeware platforms.


* Our approach provides ecologists and conservation biologists with a clear method for selecting the most appropriate software platform that meets their needs when developing SDMs coupled with population-dynamic processes. We argue that informed tool choice will translate to better predictions of species responses to climate and land-use change and improved conservation management.},

	Abstract = {Herbivores play an important role in determining the structure and function of tropical savannahs. Here, we (i) outline a framework for how interactions among large mammalian herbivores, carnivores and environmental variation influence herbivore habitat occupancy in tropical savannahs. We then (ii) use a Bayesian hierarchical model to analyse camera trap data to quantify spatial patterns of habitat occupancy for lions and eight common ungulates of varying body size across an approximately 1100 km2 landscape in the Serengeti ecosystem. Our results reveal strong positive associations among herbivores at the scale of the entire landscape. Lions were positively associated with migratory ungulates but negatively associated with residents. Herbivore habitat occupancy differed with body size and migratory strategy: large-bodied migrants, at less risk of predation and able to tolerate lower quality food, were associated with high NDVI, while smaller residents, constrained to higher quality forage, avoided these areas. Small herbivores were strongly associated with fires, likely due to the subsequent high-quality regrowth, while larger herbivores avoided burned areas. Body mass was strongly related to herbivore habitat use, with larger species more strongly associated with riverine and woodlands than smaller species. Large-bodied migrants displayed diffuse habitat occupancy, whereas smaller species demonstrated fine-scale occupancy reflecting use of smaller patches of high-quality habitat. Our results demonstrate the emergence of strong positive spatial associations among a diverse group of savannah herbivores, while highlighting species-specific habitat selection strongly determined by herbivore body size.

@article{illius_resource_2000,
	Abstract = {It has been suggested that climatic variation has the effect on the dynamics of arid and semi-arid grazing systems of reducing animal numbers below the level at which they have much impact on vegetation or soils, and that spatial heterogeneity in resource availability serves to buffer herbivores against climatic variation. Modelling was used to test these hypotheses and to examine the interacting effects of temporal and spatial variability in plant production on animal population dynamics and defoliation intensity. The model distinguishes areas of the range that are accessible during wet and dry seasons, and examines the effect of seasonal restrictions in foraging area. It was established that the animal population is in long-term equilibrium with dry-season resources, on which it depends for survival; that dry season resource areas and outlying areas thus operate in a source-sink manner; and that the ratio of these areas determines the strength of consumer-resource coupling outside the dry-season range. A high ratio of dry season to wet season resources may support a sufficiently large animal population to impose non-trivial defoliation impacts on the outlying range. Increasing degrees of variability in primary production on areas used by animals for surviving the dry season increased the annual variation in animal abundance and reduced the mean. By comparison with a stable environment, for which the model predicts virtually stable animal numbers and constant, low defoliation intensity, variation in annual rainfall causes wide fluctuations in animal numbers and defoliation intensity. Under climatic variation, animal numbers can build up enough to impose much higher defoliation intensities than under a constant regime. Periodic intense defoliation is a consequence of climatic variability which is likely to make these environments more, not less, prone to ecological change.},

	Abstract = {Global declines in insects have sparked wide interest among scientists, politicians, and the general public. Loss of insect diversity and abundance is expected to provoke cascading effects on food webs and to jeopardize ecosystem services. Our understanding of the extent and underlying causes of this decline is based on the abundance of single species or taxonomic groups only, rather than changes in insect biomass which is more relevant for ecological functioning. Here, we used a standardized protocol to measure total insect biomass using Malaise traps, deployed over 27 years in 63 nature protection areas in Germany (96 unique location-year combinations) to infer on the status and trend of local entomofauna. Our analysis estimates a seasonal decline of 76\%, and mid-summer decline of 82\% in flying insect biomass over the 27 years of study. We show that this decline is apparent regardless of habitat type, while changes in weather, land use, and habitat characteristics cannot explain this overall decline. This yet unrecognized loss of insect biomass must be taken into account in evaluating declines in abundance of species depending on insects as a food source, and ecosystem functioning in the European landscape.},

In many ecological models, intake of nutrients by plants and consumption of food by animals is considered to be a hyperbolic function of the nutrient concentration and the food density, respectively. However, data on the concentration (or density) at which half of the maximum intake rate is reached are scarce, limiting the applicability of the computational models. The meta-analysis was conducted on literature published worldwide. Most studies focused on algae and invertebrates, whereas some included fish, birds and mammals. The half-saturation constants obtained were linked to body size using ordinary regression analysis. The observed trends were compared to those noted in reviews on other density parameters. Half-saturation constants for different clades range within one or two orders of magnitude. Although these constants are inherently variable, exploring allometric relationships across different taxa helps to improve consistent parameterization of ecological models.},

@article{caldwell_coping_1981,
	Abstract = {SummaryAgropyron desertorum, a grazing-tolerant bunchgrass introduced to the western U.S. from Eurasia, and Agropyron spicatum, a grazing-sensitive bunchgrass native to North America, were examined in the field for photosynthetic capacity, growth, resource allocation, and tiller dynamics. These observations allowed identification of physiological characteristics that may contribute to grazing tolerance in semiarid environments. A uniform matrix of sagebrush, Artemisia tridentata, provided an ecologically relevant competitive environment for both bunch-grass species. Physiological activity, growth, and allocation were also followed during recovery from a severe defoliation treatment and were correlated with tiller dynamics.Potential photosynthetic carbon uptake of both species was dominated by stems and leaf sheaths during June, when maximum uptake rates occurred. For both species, water use efficiency of stems and sheaths was similar to that of leaf blades, but nitrogen investment per photosynthetic surface area was less than in blades. In addition, soluble carbohydrates in stems and sheaths of both species constituted the major labile carbon pools in control plants. Contrary to current theory, these findings suggest that culms from which leaf blades have been removed should be of considerable value to defoliated bunchgrasses, and in the case of partial defoliation could provide important supplies of organic nutrients for regrowth. These interpretations, based on total pool sizes, differ markedly from previous interpretations based on carbohydrate concentrations alone, which suggested that crowns contain large carbohydrate reserves. In this study, crowns of both species contained a minor component of the total plant carbohydrate pool.Following defoliation, A. desertorum plants rapidly reestablished a canopy with 3 to 5 times the photosynthetic surface of A. spicatum plants. This difference was primarily due to the greater number of quickly growing new tillers produced following defoliation. Agropyron spicatum produced few new tillers following defoliation despite adequate moisture, and carbohydrate pools that were equivalent to those in A. desertorum.Leaf blades of regrowing tillers had higher photosynthetic capacity than blades on unclipped plants of both species, but the relative increase, considered on a unit mass, area, or nitrogen basis, was greater for A. desertorum than for A. spicatum. Agropyron desertorum also had lower investment of nitrogen and biomass per unit area of photosynthetic tissues, more tillers and leaves per bunch, and shorter lived stems, all of which can contribute to greater tolerance of partial defoliation.Greater flexibility of resource allocation following defoliation was demonstrated by A. desertorum for both nitrogen and carbohydrates. Relatively more allocation to the shoot system and curtailed root growth in A. desertorum resulted in more rapid approach to the preclipping balance between the root and shoot systems, whereas root growth in A. spicatum continued unabated following defoliation. Nitrogen required for regrowth in both species was apparently supplied by uptake rather than reserve depletion. Carbohydrate pools in the shoot system of both species remained very low following severe defoliation and were approximately equivalent to carbon fixed in one day by photosynthesis of the whole canopy.},

	Abstract = {In frequently burnt mesic savannas, trees can get trapped into a cycle of surviving fire-induced stem death (i. e. topkill) by resprouting, only to be topkilled again a year or two later. The ability of savanna saplings to resprout repeatedly after fire is a key component of recent models of tree-grass coexistence in savannas. This study investigated the carbon allocation and biomass partitioning patterns that enable a dominant savanna tree, Acacia karroo, to survive frequent and repeated topkill. Root starch depletion and replenishment, foliage recovery and photosynthesis of burnt and unburnt plants were compared over the first year after a burn. The concentration of starch in the roots of the burnt plants (0.08 $\pm$ 0.01 g g⁻¹) was half that of the unburnt plant (0.16 $\pm$ 0.01 g g⁻¹) at the end of the first growing season after topkill. However, root starch reserves of the burnt plants were replenished over the dry season and matched that of unburnt plants within 1 year after topkill. The leaf area of resprouting plants recovered to match that of unburnt plants within 4-5 months after topkill. Shoot growth of resprouting plants was restricted to the first few months of the wet season, whereas photosynthetic rates remained high into the dry season, allowing replenishment of root starch reserves. ¹⁴C labeling showed that reserves were initially utilized for shoot growth after topkill. The rapid foliage recovery and the replenishment of reserves within a single year after topkill implies that A. karroo is well adapted to survive recurrent topkill and is poised to take advantage of unusually long fire-free intervals to grow into adults. This paper provides some of the first empirical evidence to explain how savanna trees in frequently burnt savannas are able to withstand frequent burning as juveniles and survive to become adults.},

@article{oesterheld_effect_1991,
	Abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that the amount of compensatory growth after defoliation is affected by the level of stress at which plants grow when defoliated and by the length of time for recovery. Growth response to defoliation went from partial compensation when plants were growing at high relative growth rates (RGR) to overcompensation when plants were more stressed and growing at low RGR. Defoliation released plants from the limitation imposed by the accumulation of old and dead tissue and this release overrode the negative effect of biomass loss. Compensatory growth resulted from a higher RGR aboveground that was not associated with a reduction in RGR belowground. Time available for recovery had a major impact on the outcome of defoliation. With a short time for recovery, RGR was decreased by defoliation because an immediate increase in net assimilation rate was overridden by a reduction in the ratio of leaf area to plant weight. After defoliation, this ratio increased quickly due to a larger allocation to leaf growth and lower leaf specific weights, resulting in higher RGR. We conclude that the compensatory response to grazing depends on the type and level of stress limiting growth. Allocation and physiological responses to stress may positively or negatively affect the response to grazing and, simultaneously, grazing may alleviate or aggravate the effects of different types of stress.},

	Abstract = {Large mammalian herbivores in grassland ecosystems influence plant growth dynamics in many ways, including the removal of plant biomass and the return of nutrients to the soil. A 10-week growth chamber experiment examined the responses of Sporobolus kentrophyllus from the heavily grazed short-grass plains of Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, to simulated grazing and varying nitrogen nutrition. Plants were subjected to two clipping treatments (clipped and unclipped) and five nitrogen levels (weekly applications at levels equivalent to 0, 1, 5, 10, and 40 g N m-2), the highest being equivalent to a urine hit. Tiller and stolon production were measured weekly. Total biomass at harvest was partitioned by plant organ and analyzed for nitrogen and mineral element composition. Tiller and stolon production reached a peak at 3-5 weeks in unclipped plants, then declined drastically, but tiller number increased continually in clipped plants; this differential effect was enhanced at higher N levels. Total plant production increased substantially with N supply, was dominated by aboveground production, and was similar in clipped and unclipped plants, except at high nitrogen levels where clipped plants produced more. Much of the standing biomass of unclipped plants was standing dead and stem; most of the standing biomass of clipped plants was live leaf with clipped plants having significantly more leaf than unclipped plants. However, leaf nitrogen was stimulated by clipping only in plants receiving levels of N application above 1 g N m-2 which corresponded to a tissue concentration of 2.5\% N. Leaf N concentration was lower in unclipped plants and increased with level of N. Aboveground N and mineral concentrations were consistently greater than belowground levels and while clipping commonly promoted aboveground concentrations, it generally diminished those belowground. In general, clipped plants exhibited increased leaf elemental concentrations of K, P, and Mg. Concentrations of B, Ca, K, Mg, and Zn increased with the level of N. No evidence was found that the much greater growth associated with higher N levels diminished the concentration of any other nutrient and that clipping coupled with N fertilization increased the total mineral content available in leaf tissue. The results suggest that plants can (1) compensate for leaf removal, but only when N is above a critical point (tissue [N] 2.8\%) and (2) grazing coupled with N fertilization can increase the quality and quantity of tissue available for herbivore removal.},
